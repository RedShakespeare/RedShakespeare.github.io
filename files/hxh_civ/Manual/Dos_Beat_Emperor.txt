Basically, there are some people who have spent quite a lot
of time playing Civilization and still can't beat it at the
highest level of difficulty - the Emperor.

This guide will offer you with some very simple strategies
which allow you to beat the game with ease even at this
level of difficulty.

 1. EXACTLY HOW DIFFICULT IS IT?
===================================================================

Don't get me wrong - even with this guide, Emperor is really
difficult. The following factors make it extremely difficult:

 --> The Computer cheats with no end. For example, the AI
     can get Wonders at their convenience.

 --> The AI researches techs at an impossible speed. They
     can get into the Future Techs (if left alone) by
     1300 AD.

 --> The AI has an advantage at city happyness. Their
     unhappyness is like your Prince difficulty.

 --> They build imporvements/units at around double speed.

Now that you know what you are up against, let's tackle the
problem!

===================================================================
 2. THE EASIEST WAY OF DOING IT
===================================================================

The way to beat the game the easiest way (I have once done
this in 17 minutes, and no, I'm not joking!) is to simply
"overmass" them. If you can't beat them technologically,
then just do it by beating them at everything else! And that
includes 

 --> Building as many cities as possible

 --> Building as many units as possible.

Basically, the number of cities you have has got to explode
at the beginning of the game. Once you have a large number
of cities (20 will usually do), you can start building units
in large numbers.

So this is a walkthrough of doing it:

 1. Start a new game. Pick Earth if you want things to be a
    little bit easier. Pick 3 Civs. Makes it easier to hunt
    them down. If you want things to be even easier, pick
    Russians. There are two reasons for doing this:
        --> The Russians have a small chance of starting with
            2 settlers. This can be very useful in your tries
            to build 20 cities as quickly as possible.
        --> The Russians start in a region full of forests.
            This is bad if you want to get your cities at high
            population, but good if you want production. As
            you want to mass-produce units, you want this type
            of landscape.

 2. Build Your city at 4000 BC. Immediately switch to building
    a Militia. Set your taxes to 0% and science to 100%. For
    research, pick them in this order:
        --> Bronze Working
        --> The Wheel
        --> Alphabet
        --> Map Making
    Once you have finished researching these techs, stop all
    research (switch taxes to 100%).

 3. Once you have build your Militia, build another one. Have
    that one walk around and explore the map. If you chose the
    Russians on earth, walk west to find either the Germans or
    the French. Walk south to find either the Zulus (bad, these
    guys are dangerous) or the Babylonians (very good, these
    guys are worthless).

 4. Once your second militia is produced, start making settlers.
    And then just continue to make settlers, and don't really
    try to stop. When you finish Bronze Working, stop building
    a settler and build an extra phalanx for protection from 
    barbarians.

 5. Don't bother building new cities far away from your capital.
    One square between cities is all that is needed. Don't 
    bother building roads, as that takes up too much time. 
    Just keep on building cities right next to each other. As
    the level of unhappyness in emperor is very high (cities
    get unhappy with size 3), keep 2 phalanxes in each of your
    cities and don't let them grow over size 4 - adjust the
    food squares so that you can have the maximum production 
    and the minimum food. Once you have everything in place,
    build some barracks.

 6. Once you have enough cities (don't think that anything
    below 20 will be enough!), you can start producing
    chariots (that is, you should have wheel by now). 

 7. If you have Zulus on your map, I suggest targeting them
    first. They will usually have no more than 5 cities. If
    you have built enough chariots (around 20, and no, it 
    doesn't take that long), you should be able to take out
    a couple of their cities. That's all you need - to weaken
    them. Once that has happened, attack the second civ on 
    your map. Weaken them down to a couple of cities. Once
    you have done that, return back to the first civ (zulus
    in my example), and destroy their capital, leaving them
    with only 1 city with no palace. Do the same for the
    second civ.

 8. You should have gotten map making by now. Using Tiremes,
    you can go anywhere on the world map if you are playing
    on the earth. Simply load your chariots and unload them
    in all parts of the world. Make sure you have the whole
    world map covered.

 9. Destroy the two opponents.

 10. Two more AI civs will be made. Of course, as you have
    your units everywhere, you will see them immediately 
    (you will see their first settlers). Leave them alone 
    (let them go out of your sight). They will create their
    first city. It will be undefended, so just take it over.
    The reason you can't kill the settlers themselves is 
    because there is a bug in civilization: if you kill a 
    civ before it has created the first settler, you will
    never win the game.

 11. Go and brag that you beat Civ 1 at emperor difficulty!

This strategy works all the time. Build as many cities as
you can, then build as many units and then just 
assassinate everyone. Good Luck!

3. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
===================================================================

Q: Is It REALLY possible to beat the game at Emperor level??
A: YES!! I didn't write this guide as a joke, OK?

Q: What is the highest score you have ever gotten in a Civ
   game?
A: I really can't remember, but I think it was 183%.

Q: What year did you finish your fastest Emperor level game?
A: It was at year 2420 BC.

Q: Apart from this beat-them-up-as-fast-as-you-can method,
   is there another way of beating Emperor.
A: Yes there is, but you should remember that you should only
   attempt to do this another way if you want to have fun,
   because you will simply make the game much more difficult 
   for no apparent reason. The way to do this is to simply do
   a conquest (like I described) to take over a continent, then
   switch all income to research and simply develop your
   cities like you normally would. For this to work, you 
   should be isolated, otherwise the AI will most likely 
   declare a war on you. Simply develop until you get Nuclear
   Weapons and then just nuke your opponents. Most likely
   they will nuke you back, but it will be fun.

Q: Why is it that I can't beat the game? I have taken every
   enemy city!
A: You must have destroyed an enemy civ before it had built
   it's first city. The only way to counter this is to
   restart the game.

Q: I can't build nearly enough chariots/cities! What did I
   do wrong???
A: Basically, to win this challenge, you have to concentrate
   on producing cities one after another. Never stop, and
   never do anything else, like research another technology
   when that money could have gone to something useful, like
   another chariot!

Q: I've been trying to do this, but my cities keep on getting
   into civil disorder! HELP!!
A: Every city should have a size 4. If it has a larger size,
   then starve it. That's right, kill off the people you don't
   want. After all, this is despotism! Each city should have 
   two phalanxes in it. That should keep the population happy!

Q: Is there anything more difficult than Emperor?
A: In theory, yes. Practically, no. Within the game itself,
   there is nothing worse than Emperor. However, you can hack
   the Civ save and edit the level of difficult one higher than
   Emperor (as far as I can remember, emperor was 4, so change
   it to 5). Get a save state hacking program if you don't know
   how to do this.
