<h3>Air Temple</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-17-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Air Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 38-42, below the Casino. The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. There are several traps, two secret passages and chaotic
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. The air
demons (or Yulgash himself) will sacrifice the PC instantly should she step on it. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or
Order, which means PCs going for an Ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.<p>

The Air Temple level features intermittent electrical discharges which will destroy both worn items and those in the pack, as well as damaging PCs without
good shock resistance or immunity. It is highly advisable to leave precious non-artifact items on the level above or below the Air Temple.<p>

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. The presence of the secret doors is actually helpful, since ideally the PC can take on the monsters
outside of the temple first, without alerting the air elementals and grues. The air elementals are very tough with many hitpoints and the ability to breathe
lightning bolts, which are another way the PC's equipment can be destroyed. The grues and demons are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that
has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually &ndash; a good reason to develop missile weapon skills. Invisibility is
tremendously useful. Only the chaos servants and Yulgash see invisible.<p>

As befits his name, Yulgash is liable to summon anything up to and including  great wyrms and ancient karmic dragons. Killing him as soon as he is aware of
the PCs presence is therefore a top priority. Yulgash is able to teleport if not on a level that prohibits it (such as the Air Temple itself), is immune to
lightning, has a corrupting melee attack, but otherwise he is NOT a spellcaster. He is vulnerable to humanoid slayers. He is immune to shock, stunning, and poison.<p>

<h4 id="3h3">3.17.3 Chaos Orb of Elemental Air <tt>]</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item303.png" alt="cooea" align="left">
Yulgash holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Air. Whilst worn in the tool slot, it raises Dexterity by 10. When <tt>U</tt>sed it summons a tame air elemental; though doing so adds 500
corruption points (250 with Elemental Gauntlets equipped). Note that while it can also be used as a melee or missile weapon, wielding it as such won't confer the Dexterity bonus.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
------------------ Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} -------------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +10.

<h4 id="3h4">3.17.4 Heavenly Area</h4>
<a href="adomgb-3-17-4-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>
The Heavenly Area is a one level branch found beneath the Air Temple. It contains various types of angels, including the Seraphim of Order.
It has a fixed layout, teleportation is not allowed, but the walls are digable. The various angels populating the level will be hostile if
the PC is chaotic. Chaotic PCs will take several points of damage per turn while on the level. Lawful PCs are granted a temporary blessing
while on the level.<p>

<h4 id="3h41">3.17.4.1 Angels <tt>X</tt></h4>
Holy slayers use poisonous melee attack. Ki-rins <tt>F</tt> are immune to all elements, rapidly regenerate, and most importantly, are able to cast Death ray.
All the "of order" creatures have paralyzing melee attack, are immune to death rays and elements except acid. All the inhabitants of
Heavenly Area are of lawful alignment, so killing them will result in a significant shift of alignment toward chaotic.<p>

The Seraphim of Order is a boss in Heavenly Area, although she is not marked as unique so one can wish for more. Killing her is necessary to complete
Kherab's third quest (section <a href="adomgb-2-4.html#2442">2.4.4.2</a>). She is immune to fire, cold, shock, and death rays. Her successful melee
attack can cause paralysis.<p>
