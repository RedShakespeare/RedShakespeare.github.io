<h2 id="M">Mindcraft</h2>
The art of Mindcraft is a very strange discipline. Many believe it to
be just another type of magic, but the truly enlightened know that it
is a very different way of using one's inner strength and willpower.<p>

Mindcrafters utilize their mental powers to generate astonishing
effects. The arts of Mindcraft and magic do not work very well
together. Only long meditation and inner peace will allow a person to
awaken the mental powers within, while magic seems to encourage active
and curious minds.<p>

The following sections will describe the mental powers available to
Mindcrafters. The number in brackets mentions the level at which the
power will become available.<p>

Be warned! The powers of Mindcraft come at a price. Artificial and
mindless beings are immune to mental powers and undead are a great
danger to all Mindcrafters. Their corrupted and insane minds are able
to turn the mental powers upon the Mindcrafter, harming or killing
him. Additionally, walls are not able to block the powers of the
mind &ndash; so be careful about what might be lurking behind the next wall
before wildly employing Mindcraft. Many beings don't like others
trying to toast their brains.
Your Mindcrafter also might want to avoid contact with corrupted
monsters. Sages claim that corrupted minds will transfer some of the
corruption to the contacting mind.<p>

Mental powers are fed with power points and if the character does not
have enough power points to activate the power, he is at a loss. Some
powers are continuous and cost power points each turn.<p>
