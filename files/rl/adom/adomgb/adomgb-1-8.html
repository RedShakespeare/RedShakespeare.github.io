<h3>Puppy Cave</h3>
The Puppy Cave is six levels deep dungeon in the north-east corner of the Drakalor Chain; the puppy is on the last level. There are some guaranteed features in the dungeon. The first is
a hive of giant ants, featuring many giant ant workers, giant ant warriors, and single giant ant queen. It is always found on the second level.
These are very difficult to kill for a low level PC and ideally should be avoided completely. They can be easily killed if you bolt
them with spells or wands. Their corpses will make the PC vomit and lose some satiation, but grant acid resistance, an otherwise rare intrinsic. The second is an open cavernous level on
the fifth level with a high monster generation rate that is characteristic of these open levels. Finally, there is a lesser vault on the last level of the dungeon. The puppy generally can be
found without fighting through the vault; this is the best course of action. There is no chance of other vaults except the one at PC: 6. It is worthwhile to do visit this dungeon
even if the time limit for the Puppy quest has passed, since shops, altars, herbs and pools can be generated in this dungeon. Hives containing bees are common but not guaranteed.<p>

The last level must be entered before four days of game time have elapsed, otherwise the puppy is generated as a corpse, presumably dying from starvation. The corpse can still be given
to the Tiny Girl for a slight lawful boost, or you can just tell girl it died for the same result, even without corpse in inventory. The cute dog corpse will not rot, however eating
it will both Curse and Doom, so should be done only in an emergency if at all.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 32, PV: 0, Hits: 6, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d3, Speed: 130.</table>
If the player reaches the bottom level before 4 ingame days have passed, the Cute Dog will be generated as a tame pet, which will follow the player around and help you fight monsters.
If you happen to turn the Cute Dog hostile it is possible to tame him again with anywhere between 5 to 15 bones. However, if it takes more than 4 days to reach the bottom of the cave,
then the Cute Dog will not be generated; instead you will find a cute dog corpse somewhere on the level.<p>
 
As might be expected, the Cute Dog is an eager, but not very good fighter, and it is quite frail, so if it starts a fight, be sure to be around to end it before the dog is hurt. Try to avoid
luring it into traps if at all possible &ndash; a single corruption trap will transform it into a writhing mass of primal chaos, which is not only a terribly tragic thing to happen
but also dangerous. Other traps, like an acid trap or spear trap might simply kill it outright.<p>
 
If the dog is returned to Terinyo alive, the PC will receive an alignment boost and the ability to randomly receive a piece of candy by talking to the Tiny Girl. Note that when the PC
enters Terinyo, the dog will stop following them and will instead follow the Tiny Girl around.<p>
 
As any other monster in the game, the Cute Dog can be deliberately killed by the PC. Doing so will provide an option to confess to the Tiny Girl after informing her of the Cute Dog's death
which prompts her to become hostile and start attacking the PC. Luckily, the whole town of Terinyo will not become hostile even if the PC fights back.<p>

The Cute Dog is one of the few unique monsters that can be wished for. A wished-for Cute Dog at any point of the game will satisfy the Puppy quest requirement if returned to Terinyo.
Bringing multiple cute dogs to Terinyo will not give multiple alignment boosts.<p>
