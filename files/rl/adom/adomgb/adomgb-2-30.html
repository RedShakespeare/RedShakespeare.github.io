<h3>Ultimate Dungeon</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-30-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>
The Ultimate Dungeon is 11 level dungeon that becomes accessible after closing the Chaos Gate. It can be entered only once by using the Weird Fire Starter on a dormant volcano. You have to lead
Yggaz the fool from Terinyo to the Ice Queen to make volcanoes dormant.<p>

The first 10 levels of the Ultimate Dungeon have random layouts. All monsters generated in the Ultimate Dungeon are generated at a high level. On the first level monsters are generated at around
level 20; on the final level they are generated at around level 50. The first 10 levels can be generated cavernous, magma-filled, or littered with bones, in addition to standard random dungeon
features.<p>

The final level has a fixed layout. The left side features random, dangerous monsters, and the chamber on the right has the supreme balor, three greater balors <tt>&amp;</tt>, six balors  <tt>&amp;</tt>, and a group of
molochs <tt>&amp;</tt> that can include emperor molochs <tt>&amp;</tt>. Baalz'ab-buul, the supreme balor, drops the Scroll of Omnipotence when killed. Emperor molochs found here will drop crumpled scrolls.<p>

Baalz'ab-buul, the supreme balor, is the boss of the Ultimate Dungeon. He is a more powerful greater balor in all respects. He is immune to fire and death rays,
has corrupting melee attack, summons random monsters and teleports. When killed, he drops eternium scimitar, scourge, and the Scroll of Omnipotence.<p>

<h4 id="2u2">2.30.2 Scroll of Omnipotence <tt>?</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item892.png" alt="soo" align="left">
The Scroll of Omnipotence is dropped by Baalz'ab-buul, the supreme balor. As such, obtaining it requires visiting the Minotaur Maze to get the Weird Fire Starter, completing the
Volcano quest, and closing the Chaos Gate, all in order to access the Ultimate Dungeon. How to successfully read the scroll is unknown. It appears as a scroll
labeled "NYAKNYAKNYAKNYAK" when unidentified.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
---------------------------- scroll of omnipotence ----------------------------

Weight: 2s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of damage.

Attempting to read the scroll produces the following:
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You unroll the scroll with shaking hands and begin to examine its content. You sadly
fail to understand the cryptic runes... although you sense that they contain the
greatest prize of them all.
</pre></table><p>

Disassembling the ADOM executable shows what was intended: if you have 99 Learning and 100 Concentration, then
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You decipher the scroll of omnipotence! A new universe opens before you. 
</pre></table><p>

The PC learns all weapon skills to maximum, learns all skills to 100, and levels to 50 if not already there.
However, this never happens &ndash; probably intentionally.
