<h2 id="J">Attributes</h2>
Attributes describe inborn qualities of a character (which nonetheless
might be modified by items, talents, skills and more). Attributes are
divided between primary attributes (which describe raw potentials like
strength of charisma) and secondary attributes (which usually derive from
primary attributes or complex formulae).<p>

<h3 id="J1">Primary Attributes</h3>
Basically, every character is described by eight attributes which
represent his abilities by birthright. Every attribute is rated from
1 to 99 (in theory). 10 is an average score, 8 is slightly below
average, 5 is quite bad, 3 is horrible, and everything below this is a
real hindrance. 13 is a good score, 15 very good, 17 exceptional, 20
very high and everything above this of epic proportions. It should be
remembered that the average PC is rated higher than normal
individuals of his (or her) race because PCs are meant to be true
heroes. The absolute maximum for all attributes is 99, which is
probably equal in power level to demigods.<p>

The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial
attribute scores. The maximum for an attribute is dependent on the
base score and the player race. These maximums can only rarely be
surpassed by natural training. This is a long and arduous process.
Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease.<p>

Attributes are rated as either primary or secondary. Secondary
attributes are derived from primary attributes and are often greatly
influenced by your experience level, class and race.
The following attributes are used:<p>

<h4 id="J11">Strength</h4>
Strength describes your ability to inflict damage in combat,
determines your carrying capacity and influences your chance to hit
opponents in melee combat. The initial hit points are also partially
based upon strength.<p>

<h4 id="J12">Learning</h4>
The learning score describes how easily your character
learns new things, how good the PC is at increasing skills and how
easily magical spells are learned. Your ability to read and write
(no, that's not automatic!) is also influenced by this score.<p>

<h4 id="J13">Willpower</h4>
This attribute describes the strength of your will. The
higher it is, the better your PC is able to resist attacks affecting
his mind. Willpower influences your initial hit points and your
initial magic points.<p>

<h4 id="J14">Dexterity</h4>
This attribute rates your agility, nimbleness, speed and
many other things. A high dexterity score allows you to better dodge enemy
attacks and traps. PCs with low dexterity are clumsy and
slow-moving&hellip; easy prey for your enemies. Dexterity is also very
important when attacking with missile weapons.<p>

<h4 id="J15">Toughness</h4>
This attribute rates your physical resistance, your
endurance, your constitution and your resistance to pain. Toughness
is a major factor influencing the number of hit points of your
character.<p>

<h4 id="J16">Charisma</h4>
This attribute describes the personality of your character.
PCs with high charisma are outgoing, friendly and easily make friends,
while characters with low charisma are disliked by many people and
have difficulties interacting on a friendly and easy-going basis.<p>

<h4 id="J17">Appearance</h4>
This attribute describes the looks of your character. PCs
with high appearance are good-looking and draw attention, while
characters with low appearance are unattractive or simply ugly but
also draw attention (unfriendly attention most of the time, that is!).
<small>Additionally the forces of Chaos find more resistance with true
beauty which results in being less susceptible to corruption for
appearance scores higher than 10 and being more susceptible to
corruption for appearance scores lower than 10 (basically each
point difference requires 1% more or less corruption to transform
the character).</small><p>

<h4 id="J18">Mana</h4>
This attribute describes the luck of your character, his
attunement to the forces of magic and his resistance to magic. Mana
is a prime determinant for magical power.<p>

<h4 id="J19">Perception</h4>
This attribute describes the general perception ability of
your character. Perception is very important. It influences how far
you can see in dungeons. Characters with low perception have
problems finding secret doors, hearing noises and noticing certain
traps &ndash; they also can't see very far in the dungeons. Characters
with high perception are very alert and notice slight details. They
have superior vision and good hearing. <big>Finally perception adds a very
minor bonus to your to-hit probabilities in ranged combat.</big><p>

<h3 id="J2">Attribute Generation</h3>
Attributes can be determined in two ways in ADOM. The easy way is
random attribute generation. Your attributes will be based on your
race and profession and a bit of luck. This means that your attributes
might be truly exceptional or pretty abysmal. The second way is
attribute generation by answering questions. Each question will
present you with a situation and four choices. Your selected choice
will modify your attributes in one or more ways. Please note that each
choice will raise one or more attributes and lower one or more other
attributes. Additionally each choice is balanced: if one attribute is
increased by an amount 'x', another attribute will be decreased by an
equal amount. The choice is yours, so to speak!<p>

<h3 id="J3">Secondary Attributes</h3>
The following secondary attributes are used:<p>

<h4 id="J31">Defensive Value (DV)</h4>
The defensive value determines how hard you are
to hit. It starts at 1, 10 is about average, and, in theory, it is
not limited in its value. The higher the value is, the harder you are
to hit. This value is influenced by race, class, dexterity,
equipment, burden level, hunger, and dozens of other factors.<p>

<h4 id="J32">Protection Value (PV)</h4>
PV determines how many points of damage are
stopped when your PC is hit by a physical attack. This value can be
positive (which means that you have adequate protection) or negative
(which means that you are carrying some kind of cursed items making
it easier for your enemies to inflict wounds upon you). This value is
influenced by your toughness, your equipment and several minor
factors.<p>

<h4 id="J33">Hit Points (HP)</h4>
Hit points represent how much punishment your character
can take before dying. The higher this value is, the better for you!
Your maximal hit points are listed in brackets. Your hit points can
decrease through combat wounds, traps, magical attacks, and many other
things. As soon as your current hit points are lower than your
maximum hit points, you start to heal wounds. How fast you heal
injuries depends upon race, class, toughness, healing skill,
equipment, general conditions, and several minor factors.<p>

<h4 id="J34">Power Points (PP)</h4>
Magical power is described by a certain number of
power points. To cast a spell (if you are able to do so), you have to
spend a certain amount of power. If you do not have enough power
points to cast a certain spell, your life energy will be drained
instead. Be careful &ndash; this might kill you! As an added side effect
abusing your body by channeling too much magic also might result in a
decreased connection to the mana flow of Ancardia <big>and heavily abuses
your physical and mental health</big>&hellip; which basically means that your
<big>Willpower, Toughness and</big> Mana attributes might decrease over
time. Your maximum power points are listed in brackets. Power is
influenced by mana, class, race, experience and willpower.<p>
