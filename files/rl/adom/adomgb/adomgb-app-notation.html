<h3>Notation for item appendices</h3>
<hr><p>

<b>+ denotes an artifact which is obtained through game plot, * an artifact which is obtained randomly. H(+h,xdy) denotes hand-to-hand damage, M(+h,xdy) missile damage.
Effect abilities conferred are abbreviated. +Tele means "grants teleportation", -Fire means "fire resistance", =Fire (two lines, get it?) means
"fire immunity". Slaying powers are denoted by !, item powers are denoted by *. ~ denotes rare item powers which usually don't feature appropriate great
identify message and apply just to a single artifact.<p>

Bad items are in <font color="red">red</font>. Most items are listed with their
unidentified appearance (UnID'd name). If this appearance is shown in (), that means the appearance is not always the same, but the "associated" or "most common"
appearance. For expendable magical items (amulets, rings, wands, potions, books, scrolls, and gems) imagine that all appearances are listed in ().<p>

All statistics are "base" numbers and can be adjusted up or down as the item appears: base odds for a chance of +/- variation for item generation is 15%.
This goes up (as high as 40%) depending on the difference between the DL PC is on and the DL of the item. There is further 10% chance of deviating from the standard
+/- 1-3 variation, but this also requires the DL difference to be high enough and at least one further 1/3 check passed (more 1/3 checks passed means more deviation).</b><p>

As always, corrections are invited.<p>
