<h3>Animated Forest, Fungal Caves and Dwarven Halls</h3>
Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find out what lies beyond. He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut which
turn out to be the Dwarven Halls DH: 1 and DH: 2. On approximately D: 14 there will be a level that has two down staircases. One leads to
the Animated Forest, the other to the Dwarven Halls. It is impossible to tell them apart.<p>

<h4 id="361">3.6.1 Animated Forest <tt>P</tt></h4>

Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience among other things. The entire level is filled with living trees milling
about. The majority are not hostile but will of course become hostile if attacked. It is difficult to get through them without accidentally
hitting one or more. When the PC encounters hostile trees it is best not to try to fight them but rather keep moving. In fact it is usually
best to be as defensive as possible and forget about offense completely: wield two shields and use Coward <tt>F7</tt> tactics. The hostile trees will
usually be left behind in the crowd. It seems to be best to keep moving in any case and refrain from resting on one tile. Invisibility is a
tremendous asset in the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it available at this stage of the game. Note that any fire based attacks
should not be used in the Animated Forest. While they are effective, the whole forest becomes hostile. This generates too many hostile trees
for a PC at this level to cope with. The trees do not see in Darkness, so that tactic can also be used.<p>

Summarizing the methods for crossing the forest:<p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-wielding shields. This prevents the player from accidentally attacking non-hostile trees, and provides extra DV/PV to reduce damage from the occasional hostile tree.
<big>In R+ casting spells is not allowed when dual wielding shields.</big>
<li>Invisibility. The trees cannot see invisible, so this (preferably combined with dual-wielding shields) generally makes progress much quicker, since even hostile
trees will occasionally move and allow the PC to progress through the forest.
<li>Darkness. The trees cannot see in darkness, so it is possible to blanket the entire level in darkness and fight through the trees with minimal risk. In theory,
panicked trees will be able to hit the PC if cornered; but it's hard to corner anything in a wide open space. It does take a lot of time to go through the entire
level this way. <big>In R+, monsters that lack the ability to see in darkness will still try to attack.</big>
<li>Digging. There's just enough space behind the eastern and northern walls that can be dug out to create a clear passageway around the forest. Close
it off using wands of door creation and avoid killing any trees henceforth, to minimize the risk of trees showing up inside the hallway.
<li>Teleportation. Controlled teleportation will greatly shorten the time spent to cross the forest. While the PC can try to teleport directly to the down stairs,
if this space is occupied (which is likely) this will teleport him to a random spot on the level. This is not a bad thing if the PC has just entered the forest
and is as far away from the opposite stairs as it gets, so it doesn't hurt to try. Otherwise it might be more prudent to teleport from empty spot to empty spot until
the down staircases are in sight, and then teleport on them once they are vacated.
</ul><p>

<div class="newb">
The top-middle of the Animated Forest has stairs leading into the Fungal Caves.<p>

<h4 id="362">3.6.2 Fungal Caves</h4>
<a href="adomgb-3-6-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Fungal Caves are a three level dungeon branch below the Animated Forest. All levels are cavernous, feature herbs, and do not allow teleportation. The final level has a river and a
special fungoid-spawning pool. The Fungoid Overlord, located on the final level, drops many valuable mushrooms as well as either the Cornucopia or the Horn of Plenty.<p>

Fungoids are found on all of the levels, although there are some random monsters as well. Mushrooms can only be acquired by killing fungoids.

The boss of the area is found on top of a special pool on the final level. It is accompanied by four fungoid sporecasters, and further fungoids will begin spawning once it steps off the pool.
As more fungoids spawn from the pool, they will be generated at higher and higher levels. The pool does not generate fungoids if a monster or the PC is standing on it, and otherwise functions like
a normal pool, eventually disappearing if the PC drinks from it a sufficient number of times.<p>

<h4 id="3621">3.6.2.1 Fungoids <tt>P</tt></h4>
Fungoids generally are vulnerable to fire, immune to mindcraft, and drop mushrooms in place of corpses. Minor fungoids can confuse, major sicken, greater paralyze, and sporecasters feature
unique spore breath attack that causes no damage, but can inflict slow, sickness, paralysis, and confusion.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 3, DV: 12, PV: 12, Hits: 235, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d10+8, Speed 120.</table>

The Fungoid Overlord is the boss of the Fungal Caves. It is tough, fast, and damaging compared to the common fungoids. Its successful melee attacks have a chance of inflicting paralysis, slow,
confusion, and sickness. Killing the Fungoid Overlord stops monsters from being generated normally within the Fungal Caves. It drops either the Cornucopia or the Horn of Plenty, along with some
special mushrooms.<p>

<img src="tiles/item888.png" alt="co" align="left">
Cornucopia can be used to increase satiation. It can be equipped in the tool slot to increase Mana and grant both +Luck and +Fate. It appears as "horn-shaped basket" when unidentified.<p>
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
------------------------------- cornucopia {Ma+13} -----------------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d6 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +13.
It on average recharges in 468-3750 turns (depending on other factors).

It makes Fate smile upon you.
</pre></table><p>

<img src="tiles/item836.png" alt="hop" align="left">
Activating the Horn of Plenty generates some random food and sometimes a potion of water. If it is activated while blessed, it will also create a patch of herbs at the PC's location.
It can be equipped in the tool slot to grant +Luck. It appears as "horn" when unidentified.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>

<h4 id="363">3.6.3 Dwarven Halls</h4>
The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent through the Dwarven Halls. This is much faster but potentially dangerous. Very
out-of-depth monsters can be generated in the Dwarven Halls. Use scroll or wand of monster detection, if possible, upon entering each level
of the Dwarven Halls. This will allow you to immediately identify any dangerous creatures, and make a judgment about whether or not the level is remotely safe
to explore. Furthermore, this will allow you to identify and avoid tension rooms. If the PC has invisibility, seven league boots or anything that increases speed,
wear them before entering in case it becomes necessary to flee. Exploring other than finding the down stairways is highly inadvisable.
Monsters that are probably too dangerous to tolerate include: balors, greater daemons, black unicorns, white unicorns, lich kings, emperor lichs, chaos wizards, quickling queens,
diamond golems, ancient dragons, titans. Vortices spawned in DH can also do immense amounts damage and must be dealt with carefully.<p>

Summarizing the useful items for the Dwarven Halls:<p>
<ul>
<li>blessed scrolls of magic mapping to locate the stairs
<li>controlled teleportation
<li>scroll or wand of monster detection
<li>invisibility
<li>seven league boots
</ul><p>

<h4 id="364">3.6.4 Your choice</h4>
Both of these locations can be problematic. The Animated Forest is always incredibly tedious. The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if the
PC is lucky enough to have the stairways generated close together. However, if the stairs are distant and the monsters dangerous,
it is probably advisable to abandon the Dwarven Halls entirely and simply cross the Animated Forest. The Halls can also be a virtual
instadeath if a very nasty monster shows up. As Thrundarr says, "It's yer choice."<p>

<h4 id="365">3.6.5 Moon Sickle <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item199.png" alt="moon sickle" align="left">
The Moon Sickle is a guaranteed artifact that is typically found between Dwarftown and Wall of Flames. It is always guarded by an unnamed stone golem.<p style="clear:none">

It is a unique artifact unlike any other in the game. It does not contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption and so does not corrupt merely by
carrying it. Likewise, wielding it does not cause corruption. However, successfully hitting a monster with Moon Sickle adds 2d3 corruption points. Although it has
no slaying powers, it is worth considering as a weapon against very difficult monsters for those PCs who have trained polearms, despite its corrupting
nature. It has excellent base to-hit and damage at +6, 10d4+6 and polearms have decent to-hit and to-damage modifiers. Remember, however, that Moon Sickle is autocursing.
In its unidentified form it appears as "ancient scythe".<p>

Also, it will create potions of raw chaos from regular potions by dipping it in them. This also means that holy water cannot be used to remove the curse.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
--------- scythe of corruption "Moon Sickle" (+6, 10d4+6) [+2, +2] ---------

Weight: 70s

When wielded it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.

When used in melee combat it grants a +6 bonus to hit and causes 10d4+6 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d4 points of damage.

It is a permanently cursed item.

(hitting a monster adds 2d3 corruption points; dipping potions turns them into raw chaos)
