<h3>Infinite Dungeon</h3>
The Infinite Dungeon is found in the southeastern part of the wilderness map. Prior to entering it, the description is "A tiny, strangely distorted cave entry."<p>

The Infinite Dungeon (ID) is truly infinite for all practical purposes. The level number is limited by a signed 32 bit integer value, but who really
cares about that? It would take many lifetimes to descend through all its levels. The danger level increases with dungeon level up to 45, which is
reached at level I135. If the player somehow manages to descend below I9999, the level counter in the status bar will instead say "I?".<p>

The ID has some unique characteristics: shops, altars, herbs, and pools are never generated. Traps are generated. Special rooms such as "smells like carrots" are also generated.
Every dungeon level is randomly generated, so leaving a level and reentering it results in a completely new dungeon level. Most artifacts left on the ground in ID will return to
the PC's inventory when they leave the level; the Sceptre of Chaos is an exception to this. It can become problematic if the PC is carrying sis &ndash; section
<a href="adomgb-3-4.html">3.4</a>. There is one special level, the SIL, where MaLaKaI resides.<p>

According to the Mad Minstrel, the ID was originally a monument built by the powers of law. The incursion of Chaos into Ancardia has twisted it into its current condition.<p>

Any non-hostile mobs, including Filk, that you <i>lose</i> in the ID will re-appear later in the wilderness to meet up with you.<p>

<h4 id="221">2.2.1 Why start the game in the Infinite Dungeon?</h4>
Starting the game in the ID is a very conservative approach for PCs that are weak at the start of the game. Given the significance of the first kill, it is probably not
advisable to make the first kill in the ID, but gaining further experience while staying on level one of the ID is about as safe as things get in ADOM. The PC can
flee from anything threatening, such as dark rooms or tension rooms, by exiting the ID and reentering. This strategy is one way to get difficult classes to experience
level five or so before the ID becomes intolerably tedious.<p>

<h4 id="222">2.2.2 Stair-hopping</h4>
<span class="credit">Credit gut.</span>
Stair hopping is the process of repeatedly ascending and descending a single staircase in the ID, for the purpose of generating hoards of items in the
continuously generated rooms. Items generated on the ID's floors will be of a danger level equal to 1/3 of the ID's dungeon level. That means only DL1 items
will be generated on ID levels 1-5. On ID levels 6-8, DL2 items can be generated, and DL3 items can be generated on ID levels 9-11. This applies to dipping items
into potions of raw chaos and exchange as well. This does not apply to guaranteed drops, like eternium gear from chaos warriors. Also, it seems that this does
not always apply to monster generation either.<p>

Benefits of stair hopping include: an easy way to acquire spellbooks, as they are all DL1, and thus available even on ID levels 1-2; an easy way to acquire extra DV/PV
points for the early game, as shields, hats, gauntlets, boots, etc... can sometimes have nice stats; an easy source of teleport control (actually the only guaranteed
source of TP control in the game), as blink dogs can be found after I4 (sometimes earlier); an easy way to acquire potions and scrolls that can save PC's life.<p>

<big>As of R+, no items ever appear on the ground in the stair rooms of the ID.</big>

<h4 id="223">2.2.3 Filk, the quickling bard <tt>p</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/382.png" alt="Filk, the quickling bard" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 500, PV: 3, Hits: 58, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4+9, Speed: 1500.</table>
Once the PC takes the quest to kill Filk from the Assassin Prince (more about this is found in section <a href="adomgb-4.html#4311">4.3.1.1</a>),
Filk appears in the Infinite Dungeon on the level corresponding to the number of first-killed monsters killed.
For example if the first monster killed was a rat and 225 rats have been killed, Filk will be found on I225. If the PC reaches the level Filk is on but leaves
the ID without slaying him, he can found randomly in the wilderness; in which case the player will be asked if they wish for Filk to accompany the PC.<p>

Filk shares the properties of karmics although he is not named as such. He is easiest killed with ball spells.<p>

When chatted to, Filk asks the PC to kill his arch enemy the Mad Minstrel. If the PC does so, though, Filk will not give any reward; he will just say
"Meisaveryhappyquickling!" when chatted with. Since killing Filk for the Mad Minstrel opens the possibility of an Ultra ending, it would be very wise for
the player to take the Mad Minstrel's side in this dispute.<p>

If the PC tries to wish for "quickling bard", lots of hostile quickling lords will be summoned instead.<p>

<h4 id="224">2.2.4 MaLaKaI, the chaos knight <tt>h</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/358.png" alt="MaLaKaI, the chaos knight" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 79, DV: 70, PV: 30, Hits: 450, Attacks: 8, Damage: 4d6+32, Speed: 110.</table>
MaLaKaI resides in the SIL (Special Infinity Level), found at level 66 of the ID. A cut above others of his kin, this chaos knight is extremely high leveled.
He can execute 8 attacks in a single turn (which can increase to 16 <big>11</big> if he fights to the death in a blind rage!),
and seems to have a high hit chance. Since his only attacks are in melee range, using ranged attacks against him is certainly recommended.<p>

All items, walls, floors and doors in the SIL change colors at every turn. The SIL is not really part of the ID. It is discovered by descending through the ID normally, but once left,
it can never be found again. MaLaKaI is quite tough. He has poisonous melee attack and attacks 8 times per round. He cannot see in darkness and is vulnerable to humanoid and demon
slaying weapons and ammo.<p>

Note that once the PC has left the SIL, they can never return to it again if they re-enter the 66th level of the ID. If they haven't collected the Sceptre, the player cannot
possibly achieve an Ordinary Chaos God ending; the game alerts the player to this with the message "You feel you leave an essential part of Chaos behind...forever". It is, however,
still possible to achieve an Ultra or Ultimate ending without the Sceptre of Chaos.<p>

Conclusive proof that the SIL is not part of the ID is the fact that altars are sometimes generated in the SIL. These can come in very handy since MaLaKaI can be sacrificed.<p>

<h4 id="225">2.2.5 Sceptre of Chaos <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item577.png" alt="soc" align="left">
MaLaKaI guards the Sceptre of Chaos, a part of Chaos Trinity. It is one-handed weapon essential for an Ordinary Chaos God ending, but is widely believed to be close to
useless as a weapon due to its significant downsides which include Dooming while it is wielded, and constant corruption while it is being wielded or just being carried.<p>

Note that as MaLaKaI is generated standing on the sceptre and not actually carrying it, it is usually possible to lure him away, teleport to the sceptre, seize it, and leave the level
without any combat. The most effective tactic for doing so is to approach him in darkness.<p>

<table style="clear:left" class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>

<h4 id="226">2.2.6 Antediluvian Dwarven Map Fragment <tt>?</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item823.png" alt="admf" align="left">
The Drunken Dwarf NPC in Lawenilothehl will eventually require you to guess the ID level this fragment is located on; the level number is an anagram of the Drunken Dwarf's name. Once this
riddle is successfully answered, a map fragment can be found on the specified ID level. This map fragment is generated on a trap, but it will automatically jump into PC's inventory upon leaving
its ID level.<p>
