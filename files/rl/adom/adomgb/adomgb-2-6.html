<h3>Old Barbarian's Clearing</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-6-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Barbarian's Clearing is an area located just south of the Caverns of Chaos on an open square within the forest. This peaceful area is home to the Old Barbarian.
It features a small building surrounded by a river, and the Old Barbarian himself.<p>

A geographical exploit makes the Barbarian's Clearing the ideal place to wish for an Emperor Moloch (which instead results in 25 or so greater molochs) for those PCs that
are desperate for experience. The greater molochs should be summoned on the far right side of the map, so they will appear bunched together there. A quick teleport, and strategic use
of frost bolt, frost bolt, fire bolt, will yield a perfectly safe ice island from which the PC can snipe her way to experience level 50 with ease.<p>

Note that the Barbarian's Clearing is a decent place to store items. He is the only monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly generated is going
to run away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian (or if he is dead), he will not have time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

The Old Barbarian assigns a quest to kill a score (20) of the monsters the PC first killed. As a reward for successfully completing the quest he teaches the Courage skill. The
quest is only available to non-chaotics and is not available until the PC has killed 500 monsters. He monitors the progress towards completing it &ndash; his feedback can be
used by the player to help them remember the PC's first kill &ndash; when chatted to during his quest he will either remark that the PC is showing promise if they have killed at least
one more of their first kill, or remark that the PC is lazy if they haven't. Note that if the PC somehow acquires the Courage skill after the quest is assigned but before it is
completed (Bard's class power, scroll or potion of education, wish), returns to the Old Barbarian and <tt>C</tt>hats with him, he is surprised and gives the PC an ordinary two-handed
sword.<p>

For more about strategy for the first kill, see section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#091">0.9.1</a>.<p>

If the player does not care about the Courage skill, the Old Barbarian can be a source of early game experience since he can be attacked from behind water tiles. There is a demo
of this. This led to more problems than it solved for the demo player, because experience level 14 was reached very quickly without the time to find equipment that was appropriate
for the level.<p>
