<h2 id="A">Introduction</h2>
Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game which
means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration of a dungeon
complex. You control a fictional character described by race, class,
attributes, skills, and equipment. This fictional character is trying to
achieve a specific goal (see below) and succeed in a difficult quest. To
fulfill the quest, you have to explore previously undiscovered tunnels and
dungeons, fight hideous monsters, uncover long forgotten secrets, and find
treasures of all kind.<p>

During the game, you explore dungeon levels which are randomly generated
each game. You might also encounter certain special levels, which present a
particular challenge or are built around a certain theme.<p>

IMPORTANT: If you are a first-time player you should read the 'How to
start' section of this manual.<p>

<h3 id="A1">The Background Story</h3>

<h4 id="A11">The Coming of Chaos</h4>
For 6000 years, the world of Ancardia was left untouched by the incursions
of Chaos, but finally the sinister forces of evil and darkness have found
this young and teeming world. In a remote mountain complex, huge dungeons
were formed by great magical powers. They seem to contain some kind of
dimensional gate which allows terrors from unknown dimensions to enter the
world of Ancardia and wreak havoc.<p>

For years, nobody understood the true cause of sudden ambushes by evil
monsters, incursions by hideous monster armies, and the rising tide of
Chaos. Finally Khelavaster, the great sage, uncovered an ancient prophecy
foretelling the Coming of Chaos &ndash; a dark and sinister time when the skill,
power and valor of a single hero would determine the future of the world.
The ancient scrolls of prophecy hinted at a remote mountain range &ndash; the
Drakalor Chain &ndash; which was destined to be the final battleground for an
epic fight between Chaos and Order. Khelavaster quickly made this known to
all the intelligent races of Ancardia.<p>

Within weeks, many heroes set out to find the source of the chaotic forces
and destroy it. Khelavaster was among the first to enter those dungeons.
Many heroes have followed him since then but no one has ever returned from
the dungeons. Thus the forces of Chaos continue their conquest and threaten
to defile Ancardia&hellip;<p>

You are one of those young heroes willing to risk your life to defeat the
forces of Chaos, gain fame, fortune, power, and ultimately save your world
and your people. After weeks of arduous travel, you have finally reached
the center of the Drakalor Chain and now face the entrance to those
dungeons of mystery which must contain a means to save your world. You were
told to visit a small village by the name of "Terinyo" and talk to the
village elder for he might have the latest information about the region.
Steady yourself and be prepared to engage in a heroic struggle for the fate
of your home world!<p>

<h4 id="A12">The Myth of Creation</h4>
The following text, taken from ancient Ancardian lore, provides further
insights into the nature of Chaos. Enjoy it if you want to get a deeper
understanding of the rich and vibrant history of Ancardia&hellip;<p>

From the tome of knowledge, written by Kheeran the Elder at the end of the
Second Age:<p>

In the beginning there was nothing, except for Gaethra, the Creator. It
shaped the universe from a tear, begotten when the First Dream ended. Based
upon the five elemental principles it was formed and perfect it was. Then
Gaethra resumed its sleep and its dream.<p>

Thus the First Age began. The world was a primeval and vibrant place,
inhabited by the first four races: the Drakelings, born from Fire, the
Elves, begotten by Air, the Dwarves, shaped from Earth and Hurthlings,
risen out of Water. But the crowning piece of its creation was Man, derived
from all four elements. Life was given by the fifth and strongest element &ndash;
Mana, the ambient magical energy of the Dream.<p>

But, as things go, sleep is not always peaceful. Where there are dreams,
there are nightmares and thus eventually Gaethra experienced the First
Nightmare and Chaos was born. A vibrant and ever-changing force, born from
darkness, Chaos only wants to change, corrupt and alter. From Fire, Orcs
were created. Out of Earth Trolls were shaped. The Dark Elves were formed
from corrupted Air and the Ratlings, lifted from tainted Water. Thus the
Second Age, the time of Chaos began. But Gaethra's Dream proved to be
stronger. The pure races united against the forces of Chaos and even the
allies of Chaos, highly eligible for change, switched sides and united
against the dark force bent upon the complete destruction of the universe
known to us all. Chaos was defeated although a new overlord, Andor Drakon,
once mortal, rose to power and swore vengeance. Here, at the beginning of
the Third Age, the Era of Peace and Tranquility, the text ends. For many
generations the world lived in peace and harmony, only disturbed by
whatever petty struggles troubled the various races. Now, many centuries
after those ancient events, Chaos once more has gathered dark forces and
tries its second incursion into the world. Dark times seem to be lying
ahead and sages even suspect that Gaethra might be awakening&hellip; whatever
meaning this might have.<p>

Others are disturbed by the very existence of Chaos&hellip; how did it come into
being if everything is Gaethra's dream? Just a passing nightmare? Or a sign
of madness&hellip;?<p>

<h4 id="A22">ADOM Deluxe compared to ADOM Classic</h4>
ADOM Deluxe is a greatly expanded version of ADOM available only on Steam
(see <a href="http://www.adom.de/steam">http://www.adom.de/steam</a>). Current prices will be around $14.99 but
might depend on your location. Check the latest price for your location
under the given link. Please note that our policy is to offer only
occasional discounts for ADOM Deluxe and we do not plan to offer discounts
larger than 10% as we believe in continuously increasing the value of ADOM

discounts.<p>

<ul>
<li>It offers many play modes (standard mode, roguelike mode, network mode,
  challenge mode, etc.).
<li>It offers many customization options to both the character generation
  process and how the game plays (e.g. you can modify starvation & hunger,
