<h3>Exit from the Unremarkable Dungeon</h3>
This is where a PC who ascends from the bottom of the Unremarkable Dungeon emerges. It is very close to the High Mountain Village and Merchant Guild. See section
<a href="adomgb-1-4.html#143">1.4.3</a> for more about the Unremarkable Dungeon and section <a href="adomgb-2-1.html">2.1</a> for more about the High Mountain Village.<p>
