<h3>Dwarven Graveyard</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-7-pic.html" target="_blank">Color maps</a><p>

The Dwarven Graveyard is located in the southeastern mountains of the wilderness map. It cannot be found until the PC talks to Thrundarr
about <tt>portal</tt>. The portal seals the lower parts of the CoC until the PC finishes this quest or removes Thrundarr from his location in
Dwarftown and <tt>h</tt>andles the lever controlling the portal. It is most definitely worth doing the quest, since two artifacts can be found in
the graveyard.<p>

Thrundarr provides stuff for accomplishing this quest. It is always equipment, though the status varies. Whether holy water is poured on Griff's grave makes little difference.

<ul>
<li>Griff destroyed in melee, no holy water poured on grave: uncursed wand of digging (0 charges), uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge), heap of 6 blessed potions of extra healing
<li>different PC, same scenario: uncursed wand of digging (5 charges), uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge), heap of 3 blessed potions of extra healing
<li>Griff destroyed in melee, poured holy water on grave afterwards: uncursed wand of digging (5 charges), uncursed wand of fireballs (3 charges), heap of 4 blessed potions of extra healing
<li>Griff destroyed by pouring holy water on grave: blessed wand of digging (2 charges), uncursed wand of fireballs (2 charges), heap of 8 blessed potions of extra healing
</ul><p>

<tt>U</tt>sing holy water on Griff's grave produces the message: "You pour some water on the ground. You are overcome by feelings of gratefulness."<p>

<h4 id="271">2.7.1 Surface level</h4>
The surface level of the graveyard is an open plain inhabited by many, many undead. There are skeletons <tt>z</tt>, zombies <tt>z</tt>, ghuls <tt>z</tt>, shadows <tt>G</tt> and wights <tt>Z</tt>
present. Remember that ghuls can paralyze, shadows drain Strength, and wights drain Toughness.<p>

</pre></table><p>

This is also probably the first time the player finds graves. See section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0df">0.13.15</a> for more about
graves and gravedigging. It is probably not worth trying to dig up the "great treasures" graves with a level 13-17 PC. The PC can always return
later if desired.<p>

If the PC has a limited supply of undead slaying ammo use it very sparingly, if at all. It will be needed in the underground level.<p>

The center of the plain contains a small building that leads to the underground level.<p>

<h4 id="272">2.7.2 Underground level</h4>
The underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard contains a labyrinth which features many traps. It is very wise to have the Detect Traps
skill while navigating this maze. Use the <tt>s</tt>earch command constantly if the PC has the Detect Traps skill. The left side of the screen is
the problematic area regarding traps. The right side of the screen is Griff's tomb, which has been taken over by Nonnak, the master
necromancer. It contains a large number of undead, including ghosts, wraiths, Griff Bloodax the undead dwarven chaos berserker and Nonnak
himself.<p>

<h4 id="2721">2.7.2.1 Griff Bloodax, the undead chaos dwarven berserker <tt>Z</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/296.png" alt="Griff Bloodax" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 14, PV: 18, Hits: 260, Attacks: 3, Damage: 4d7+4, Speed: 100.</table>
Griff Bloodax is a brute force opponent. He can be killed by pouring holy water on his grave. He does not seem to have any 
special attacks, though his melee attack is formidable for a level 13 PC. Note that Griff is teleportation resistant.
Therefore simply trying to teleport him away in order to reach his grave and <tt>U</tt>se holy water will not work. Using
undead slaying ammo is very effective against him, while melee with a low-teens experience level PC may be difficult.<p>

<h4 id="2722">2.7.2.2 Nonnak, the master necromancer <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/295.png" alt="Nonnak" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 35, PV: 0, Hits: 260, Attacks: 1, Damage: 9d3+9, Speed: 100.</table>
Nonnak created the undead guarding the tomb. He is vulnerable to fire-based attacks. He uses Frost Bolt as an offensive spell
and regenerates health. PCs without cold resistance will have a very hard time defeating him. He is also a summoner.
Note that both Griff Bloodax and Nonnak must be dead to fulfill Thrundarr's quest.<p>

<h4 id="2723">2.7.2.3 Elemental Gauntlets <tt>[</tt></h4>
There are two artifacts hidden in Nonnak's lair. The Elemental Gauntlets are found in a hidden room in the center of the eastern wall.
They are guarded by a Bone Golem <tt>Y</tt> and are always located on a trap. The Bone Golem is not difficult to defeat for a PC that has made
it through the Dwarven Graveyard.<p>
<img src="tiles/383.png" alt="Bone Golem" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 18, Hits: 80, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d9+6, Speed: 90.</table><p>

The Elemental Gauntlets are an extremely useful item, which can be considered as three indestructible dragon-hide gauntlets combined into
one with a slightly better protection value of +3. Being artifact, they can't easily be destroyed, and as long as PC's gauntlets are intact,
rings underneath them can't be destroyed, making the Elemental Gauntlets a foolproof way to keep equipped rings safe. The three resistances
the gauntlets offer are moderately useful as well, and the combination of the Elemental Gauntlets and a ring of fire resistance underneath
provides much of the protection a player needs to survive the Tower of Eternal Flames.<p>

<img src="tiles/item449.png" alt="eg" align="left">
Their most important property, however, is not revealed by a greater identify: if they are equipped, the corruption cost from <tt>U</tt>sing
a Chaos Orb is halved. Thus, for example, the penalty for using the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water is reduced from 600 points of corruption to 300.
If there is any chance the player might need to use one of the Chaos Orbs, the Elemental Gauntlets are vital. Players planning on using the
water orb for healing during tough battles must remember to equip the Elemental Gauntlets in advance.<p>

<table style="clear:left" class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
------------------- elemental gauntlets (-1, +0) [+0, +3] ------------------

Weight: 10s

When worn they modify DV by +0 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat they grant a -1 bonus to hit and cause 1d2 points of damage.
When used as a missile they grant a +0 bonus to hit and cause 1d2 points of damage.

They grant resistance to fire.
They grant resistance to cold.
They grant resistance to shock attacks.

(they also halve the corruption caused by using the Chaos Orbs)

<h4 id="2724">2.7.2.4 Sword of Nonnak <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item448.png" alt="son" align="left">
The Sword of Nonnak is located in Griff Bloodax's grave in the center of Nonnak's lair. It is necessary to have some means of
digging to retrieve it. The sword is quite important for Wizards, Mindcrafters and other classes dependent upon Willpower.
It grants +5 to Willpower. The resistance to death attacks might be useful for ranged characters in combat against foes which are
capable of casting Death Rays. Otherwise, the Sword of Nonnak is a quite popular ratling fodder artifact.<p>

Only Dwarves are able to understand the inscription on the Griff's grave: "Griff Bloodax, mighty dwarven warrior, is buried here."
Note that digging up Griff's grave to retrieve the sword is a chaotic act, like any gravedigging.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
---------------- sword of Nonnak (+2, 4d3+2) [+2, +2] {Wi+5} ---------------

Weight: 80s

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 4d3+2 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a -2 bonus to hit and causes 3d3+1 points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +5.
It grants resistance to cold.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
