<h3>Stone Circle</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-17-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Stone Circle is located in the northwest part of the wilderness map. It can only be entered by PCs who have satisfied the Demented Ratling (section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#358">3.5.8</a>).
Furthermore, it can only be entered during very last hour of Darknight, between 23:00 and 00:00 (press <tt>Ctrl-e</tt>). The best tactic is to wear seven league boots and walk in wilderness
tiles next to the Stone Circle. Keep a very close eye on the clock and note how much time each move takes so you can calculate your steps exactly. The message "One of the monoliths seems
to contain a shimmering portal." is generated when the PC stands on the Stone Circle tile when it is eligible for entrance.<p>

The Stone Circle is located on a plain. There is an entrance tunnel guarded by two chaos knights <tt>h</tt> who should not be a problem for a PC at this level. The
doorway into the circle is guarded by two annihilators <tt>C</tt>, who can annoyingly destroy the PC's equipment. Ideally the PC should be invisible and destroy them from a
distance. The alternative should be to hit them as hard as possible with the best melee attack available.<p>

Inside the main room are 8 writhing masses of primal chaos <tt>j</tt>, Keriax, the multi-headed chaos dragon <tt>W</tt>, and unique pool <tt>0</tt>. Drinking from the pool results in the
message "You feel altered in an eerie way." It always causes 10d100 corruption points in addition to normal effect.<p>

As a chaotic spellcaster, Keriax's spells are stronger on Darknight. Though it is necessary to enter the Stone Circle then, it is advisable to wait until Darknight passes
before fighting him.<p>

Then it is important to dispatch Keriax quickly, as he has a variety of very nasty attacks. He is able to breathe
elemental bolts which corrupt, confuses the PC and drains attributes if engaged in melee. He is immune to fire and also regenerates his wounds.
His melee attacks are not corrupting, although he has five attacks per round and uses poison. He has one of the strongest confusion attacks in the game, regularly confusing high
Wi PCs with confusion resistance. He is vulnerable to confusion himself, however. He is vulnerable to non-fire based ball spells, death rays, stunning, paralyzation and dragon slaying ammo.
Potions of poison, cure poison, blindness, confusion, cure corruption, and cursed potions of invisibility work on him. Killing him from a distance is highly recommended.<p>

His corpse grants large increases to Strength, Toughness, Mana and Perception, but also causes massive corruption &ndash; about 8
corruptions. If he is killed late in the game and a PC needs corruptions for an Avatar of Balance or Ultimate Chaos God ending,
this is one way to get them quickly.<p>

<h4 id="2h2">2.17.2 Crown of Chaos <tt>[</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item576.png" alt="coc" align="left">
The objective here is the Crown of Chaos, which Keriax holds. As with all parts of the Chaos Trinity, it inflicts both Cursed and Doomed intrinsics on the PC when worn, and corrupts the PC merely
by carrying it. It appears as "obsidian crown" when unidentified, though the fact it is dropped by Keriax should be a clue to what the PC has found anyway. Put it someplace safe until it is needed.<p>
