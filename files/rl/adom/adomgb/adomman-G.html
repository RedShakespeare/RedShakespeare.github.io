<h2 id="G">Skills</h2>
Each character possesses a certain number of skills which allow for
actions that cannot be simply described by class, level and race.
Skills are rated as a score of 0 to 100. The score given can be
assumed to be the average chance of success in percent when trying an
average feat. This chance is lowered when trying something difficult
and raised when trying something simple. There is always a chance for
automatic success and automatic failure.<p>

<h3 id="G1">Skill List</h3>
Some skills need training material so that you can improve them. On the
skill screen in the game, such skills are marked with '(mr)', if training
material is still required (and thus currently no improvement is possible)
or with '(ma)' if the required training material is available.<p>

Skills can be marked so that you can select often used skills a lot faster.
How to do this is described at the end of this section.<p>

Not all the skills listed below are immediately available to your
character. Some are available to everyone by default, some skills are
determined by your race and some by your class. If you receive a skill due
to class <i>and</i> race, the skill score will be higher than normal. The
following skills are available during the game:<p>

<h4 id="G11">Alchemy</h4>
Alchemy allows you to brew magical potions. To use this
skill, you need to collect the ingredients required to mix magical
potions. It would also be useful to have the recipe for a potion at
hand.<p>

<h4 id="G12">Alertness</h4>
This skill is used automatically. It helps to
sense traps and invisible monsters although it is not too effective
(which basically means that an active search for traps with the
respective skill has a much higher chance of success). It can save
your character from some nasty surprises at times. It's also <b>very</b>
helpful when trying to dodge combat magic since high reflexes (as
created by a high alertness skill) will help to dodge combat magic
with lightning speed. Finally, a high skill value grants some minor DV
bonuses, +1 at 75+, +2 at 90+ and +4 at 100.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G13">Appraising</h4>
This skill allows the estimation of the value and
power of unknown items. Items are rated on the following scale:<p>
<ul>
<li>horrible
<li>terrible
<li>poor
<li>mediocre
<li>fair
<li>good
<li>great
<li>superb
<li>amazing
</ul><p>
A score of poor and below should be considered to be a warning.
Handle such items with great care!<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G14">Archery</h4>
This skill increases your proficiency with missile weapons.
Archers receive a bonus of +1 to hit per 10 points in this score and a
bonus of +1 to damage per 20 points in this score. All other classes
receive a bonus of +1 to hit per 25 points in this skill and a bonus of +1
to damage per 40 points of skill score. This skill also slightly increases
the range of your missile attacks on a successful skill check (which is done
automatically whenever you use a missile).<p>

<h4 id="G15">Athletics</h4>
This is a passive skill. It is used to raise your
physical attributes by training your muscles and movement powers. Whenever
you raise a level, this skill influences your chance to raise a physical
attribute. Athletics works especially well for characters with low (&lt; 10)
to very low (&lt; 5) physical attributes. The skill also slightly influences
your looks.<p>
Athletics also affect your speed score. At 70+ you gain +1 to
speed, at 75 you gain +2 to speed, at 80 you gain +3 to speed, at 85
you gain +4 to speed, at 90 you gain +5 to speed, at 95 you gain +6 to
speed and at 100 you gain +8 to speed.<p>

<h4 id="G16">Backstabbing</h4>
This skill increases your chance to hit and
your chance to score a critical hit when you attack friendly or
neutral monsters (or on hostile monsters if they don't notice you).
<big>Note that daggers and knives are particularly effective when
backstabbing others.</big><p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G17">Bridge Building</h4>
This skill allows you to build bridges.<p>

<h4 id="G18">Climbing</h4>
This skill is used to climb out of pits and holes.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G19">Concentration</h4>
This skill influences the time required to regenerate lost magic points. A
high skill value also makes it easier to learn new spells. Scores of 75+
allow you to regain mana points a lot faster; the rate increases again at
90+ and 100.<p>

<h4 id="G1a">Cooking</h4>
Cooked food is more nutritious and less prone to rot
away. Very effective if used on corpses. You need a cooking set to
use this skill.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1b">Courage</h4>
It is difficult to be a cold-blooded warrior when you
are surrounded by dozens of enemies in a horrible fray. Usually, your
PC will receive disadvantages in combat when surrounded and attacked
by lots of opponents. Once a certain critical number of attackers is
surpassed (two for fighters, paladins, rangers, monks, barbarians and
beastfighters; one for all others), your combat abilities will
deteriorate. Your character receives a -1 to hit per monster above the
critical number, the monsters above the critical number receive a +2
to hit per such monster and your chances to hit with missiles are
reduced by -4 per monster above the critical number&hellip;<p>
&hellip;unless you know this skill. It will allow you to
remain calm and cold-headed in bloody situations and thus mass attacks
by monster hordes might be less effective. It's a skill you need to
learn somewhere <b>in</b> the game.<p>

<h4 id="G1c">Detect Item Status</h4>
This skill is automatically used to determine the {cursed|uncursed|blessed} status of items.<p>

<h4 id="G1d">Detect Traps</h4>
This skill must be explicitly used to discover hidden traps. It also helps to avoid known traps. The 'Search'
command also activates this skill.<p>

<h4 id="G1e">Disarm Traps</h4>
This skill allows disarming previously
discovered traps. Be careful&hellip; if you fail a check badly, you might
spring the trap!<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1f">Dodge</h4>
This skill increases your Defensive Value. The higher
your dodge skill, the more points will be added to your DV (+1 for
Dodge 1-30, +2 for Dodge 31-50, +3 for Dodge 51-65, +4 for Dodge
66-75, +5 for Dodge 76-83, +6 for Dodge 84-90, +7 for Dodge 91-95, +8
for Dodge 96-99 and +10 for Dodge 100). Dodging is also helpful in a
minor way for evading combat magic cast on you (Alertness is more
helpful since it trains the subconscious reflexes, which are more
important since combat magic is so fast).<p>

<h4 id="G1g">Find weakness</h4>
This skill increases your chance to score a critical hit when fighting monsters.<p>

<h4 id="G1h">First aid</h4>
This skill allows handling bleeding wounds and
even might allow you to recover some hit points&hellip; but only if those
hit points were lost very recently.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1i">Fletchery</h4>
With this skill, you can create new arrows and bolts.
You need a fletchery set and some wood to use it.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>


<h4 id="G1j">Food preservation</h4>
This skill is automatically used. Certain
types of food (mainly corpses) decompose over the time and finally
vanish. Food preservation helps to prevent such food from decomposing. If
given enough time, food will nonetheless decompose&hellip; this skill only helps
to slow down the process. It also makes it more likely to find corpses
of monsters you slay.<p>

<h4 id="G1k">Gardening</h4>
This skill enables the character to plant herbs and
harvest them later. This might come handy since some herbs have
magical properties.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1l">Gemology</h4>
This skill is used to identify gems and separate them from worthless pieces of glass.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>


<h4 id="G1m">Haggling</h4>
This skill allows the haggling down of prices for
items. Charisma is also important, but a PC good at haggling probably
will have few problems to make a bargain. Please note that although
you might have bargained successfully at times, the price for
individual items won't necessarily go down since ADOM drops all
fractions and rounds prices.<p>

<h4 id="G1n">Healing</h4>
Healing covers long-term treatment of wounds and
diseases. Long-term treatment is used automatically. A high healing
skill allows for a quicker hit point recovery. Additionally, the
chances to survive wasting sicknesses are greatly increased by a high
healing skill.<p>

<h4 id="G1o">Herbalism</h4>
Herbalism covers both plant and herb lore. A
character skilled in herbalism will be better able to recognize some
of the strange plants that grow in the dungeons. Additionally, when
collecting herbs, such a character will have a definite advantage over
unskilled characters, because unskilled characters only will be able
to find cursed herbs.<p>

<h4 id="G1p">Law</h4>
Law allows you to notice (maybe) whenever you go
beyond law and commit a chaotic act. It will also make known to you
particularly lawful acts.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1q">Listening</h4>
This skill makes you notice sounds better. It is
automatically checked whenever the need arises. If you want your character
to be very perceptive, you should take care of your skill value in
this skill.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1r">Literacy</h4>
This skill governs your ability to read and
write texts. If your learning score is at least 10 and you are
neither a barbarian nor a beastfighter, you will receive this skill for
free.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1s">Metallurgy</h4>
This skill is automatically used. When you
discover metal ingots, it allows for automatic identification (not
always, but&hellip;). It is of great importance to weaponsmiths. It can
also be actively used to determine the type of metal an item is made
from (the item needs to be identified for this). The higher your
skill score is, the more detailed the results will be.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1t">Mining</h4>
This skill determines your ability in digging
tunnels. You'll need to use a pick axe to do that. The higher the
skill is, the less time you need to dig a tunnel section.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1u">Music</h4>
This skill controls your ability to play musical
instruments. Some people contend that it is possible to tame wild
animals if you are a very skilled musician.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1v">Necromancy</h4>
This dark and forbidden art allows the user to
create undead creatures which will serve him (or her). But there is a
price to it&hellip; and don't forget to bring the necessary corpses for
animation. Using this skill permanently drains your Mana attribute,
although it is said that your Mana very slowly regenerates itself (but
this really seems to be a tedious process).<p>

It's also important to note that Necromancers using this
skill are a lot more versatile than simple dabblers in necromantic
affairs. Necromancers receive a wide variety of choices for the type
of undead they wish to create (starting with level 18).<p>

<h4 id="G1w">Pick locks</h4>
This skill allows the opening of locked doors,
chests and hatches. To utilize it you need some kind of thieves
picks. If a lock is trapped, the trap will probably be sprung unless
you disarm the trap before picking the lock.<p>

<h4 id="G1x">Pick pockets</h4>
This skill enables you to steal small items from the
pockets of certain monsters. Not every monster will carry treasures
around, not every treasure will be accessible and finally you always risk
making your victim very angry (at least if your victim notices your
attempt).<p>

<h4 id="G1y">Smithing</h4>
Smithing allows the PC to repair damaged or
broken metal items and to improve weapons and armor. It is hard to
use because you need the necessary tools to practice it, the material
to work with, and finally, you have to find a smithy.<p>

<h4 id="G1z">Stealth</h4>
This skill prevents some monsters from noticing
the player character. If you are very good at it you might be able to
sneak past monsters or mount a surprise attack. The Stealth skill also
is extremely helpful in ambushing monsters in the wilderness. In that
special case it can be supplemented by the Survival skill.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1z1">Survival</h4>
This skill allows the character to gather food while
traveling through the wilderness. It can be very handy since more
than one adventurer already starved in the wilderness. The Survival skill also
is extremely helpful in ambushing monsters in the wilderness. In that
special case it can be supplemented by the Stealth skill.<p>

If the skill score is greater than or equal to 80, ADOM will internally
always make two skill checks when one was requested by the circumstances
and use the better result. If the skill score is equal to 100, ADOM will make three skill checks
whenever requested to do so and will also use the best result.<p>

<h4 id="G1z2">Swimming</h4>
This skill enables you to traverse bodies of water. To
fail an attempt to swim can be very deadly nonetheless.<p>

<h4 id="G1z3">Tactics</h4>
This skill modifies the bonuses and penalties yielded
by the <tt>T</tt> command (see the command list) which influences the
fighting techniques of a character. No character starts out with this
skill &ndash; you'll have to learn it somewhere.<p>

<h4 id="G1z4">Two weapon combat</h4>
This skill increases your offensive power
when fighting with two weapons. Your chance to hit is increased by +1
per 20 points in this skill. Note that fighting with two weapons
costs 800 energy points plus the maximum of the weapon speeds for the
weapons being used, minus 4 energy points per skill point in this
skill.<p>

<h4 id="G1z5">Ventriloquism</h4>
This skill can be used to confuse monsters.
You try to project another voice and if successful, this helps to
confuse monsters for two or more turns. This skill is very difficult
to use effectively.<p>

<h4 id="G1z6">Woodcraft</h4>
Whoever uses this skill is able to act competently
while crossing woods and trying to work on trees. <big>Additionally it
slightly increases the probability to score critical hits on plant monsters.</big>
Many woodcutters and rangers learn this skill.<p>

<h3 id="G2">Increasing Skills</h3>
Skills can be increased in several ways. If you practice a skill quite a lot, you might receive automatic
increases in your skill score from time to time.<p>

You are also allowed to raise your skill score when you advance to
a new level. Increasing skills in this way is not very effective since you
are normally not allowed to increase your skills by a lot of points when
advancing a level. Practicing the skill often and training a little bit
(it is said that some skilled trainers are living in the area known as the
Drakalor Chain) can help a lot in this regard.<p>

<h3 id="G3">Marking Skills for Quick Selection</h3>
By using the <tt>a</tt> command you can mark skills with a number from 0 to 9.
This allows you to quickly select skills you like to use very
often in a speedier way. If you have marked one or more skills and
press the <tt>a</tt> key, you will be asked whether you want to use a marked
skill or choose from the complete list.<p>

Since many skills in ADOM are passive (automatically used), it might be a
good idea to mark such skills as 'Detect Traps', 'First Aid' and others.<p>
