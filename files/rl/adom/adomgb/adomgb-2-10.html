<h3>Gremlin Cave</h3>
The Gremlin Cave is located in the southwest corner of the Drakalor Chain. As the name implies, it is infested with gremlins and has several special features thematically and
practically useful for its inhabitants.<p>

There are messages generated when the PC enters the Gremlin Cave: "You feel watched. You shiver. You shiver really bad! It's dark here!".
The Gremlin Cave is dark, and only gremlins <tt>I</tt> are ever generated there. It is filled with water traps, which, when triggered by the gremlins, cause them to multiply.
Things can get out of control quickly in this cave due to the rapid replication of the gremlins. The Disarm Trap spell or skill can be very valuable here &ndash; if the traps are taken out,
the gremlin hordes can be dealt with eventually.<p>

The cave is also a source of fluff balls <tt>]</tt>, and climbing set <tt>]</tt>. Zapping a wand of item detection or reading a scroll of item detection immediately upon
arriving is generally a good idea, especially if controlled teleportation is available.<p>

The fluff balls found here are portable "gremlin bombs". On exposure to water (water traps, rivers, potions of water, the entire Water Dragon Lair, rain), they turn into a gremlin,
which then multiplies from the same water source. So bringing them underwater is interesting. ;-) Picking them up and carrying around the Gremlin Cave without a waterproof blanket can
easily make things worse if the PC is hit by a water trap.<p>

Note that it is in no way necessary to enter this cave to complete the game. It is simply a source of an expendable artifact which can be sacrificed,
given to the Demented Ratling or sold. The climbing set is also useful of course, especially if the PC has missed the opportunity to enter the Pyramid.<p>

Gremlins can see in darkness (of course). They are damaged by the Light spell, wands of light, scrolls of light, crystals of light or by using the phial. An amulet of light, a torch, adequate
castings of the Light spell or many wands of light are necessary simply to see and navigate the cave. If the PC is fairly buff, the Gremlin Cave can be used to train weapon skills, since a
potentially infinite number of gremlins will be generated. The gremlins will eventually become too experienced to contend with.<p>

<h4 id="2a2">2.10.2 Phial of Caladriel <tt>!</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item516.png" alt="poc" align="left">
The cave contains the Phial of Caladriel, which is an artifact potion, and is located in farthest possible corner from the entrance. It appears as "crystal phial" when unidentified.
Though it is classified as a potion, it cannot be drunk or used for Alchemy; rather, it can be <tt>U</tt>sed to light up the area around the PC. Doing so drains all PP; the
effect radius depends on the amount of PP used.<p>

Perhaps the most notable use for the Phial of Caladriel is throwing it at a humanoid opponent, which sets off a flash that blinds the target. Blindness usually lasts for
about five or six turns.<p>

Weight: 2s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.

(uses up PP to generate light, and blinds monsters when thrown except undead and constructs)

<h4 id="2a3">2.10.3 Scumming the Gremlin Cave</h4>
In version 1.1.1 and earlier the Gremlin Cave was a natural environment for a setup called gremlin bomb &ndash; the PC with a companion will stay in one place and repeatedly use Pick
Pockets skill on gremlins whereas her companion will ensure the constant stream of new gremlins to steal from by dispatching already cleaned ones. This way, gremlins do not get
more experienced (as the PC is not the one who does the killing) and a great number of items are generated in safe and fast in real time (but not turn-wise) fashion.
As pick-pocketing only produces items weighing less than 10 stones, only a specific set of items are obtained &ndash; mostly gold, potions, wands, gems, scrolls, amulets and rings. If
the DL of the Gremlin Cave is slightly boosted by scrolls of danger, powerful items such as rings of djinni summoning, the primary target of the whole endeavor, can be generated.<p>

<small>As of R+ gremlins can no longer be pickpocketed removing the possibility of employing the gremlin bomb strategy.</small><p>
