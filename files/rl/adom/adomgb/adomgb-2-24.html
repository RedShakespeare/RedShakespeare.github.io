<h3>Eerie Glade</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-24-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Eerie Glade is a hidden location on the wilderness map, found to the north of the Mad Minstrel's Clearing. It is revealed on the wilderness map by first talking to Thrundarr about
<tt>Rolf</tt>, and then talking to the Grizzled Dwarven Veteran twice.<p>

The glade features several dwarven graves, along with a single special grave. Digging up the special grave yields truesilver cap, truesilver chain mail, medium truesilver shield,
amulet of perseverance, broken truesilver battle axe, Ancient Dwarven Key, and antediluvian scroll covered with dwarven runes. The key is needed for part of the Rolf quest.
Digging up the other graves will occasionally yield some random treasure, in addition to producing a hostile dwarven battle spirit.<p>

Only Dwarf PCs are able to decipher the scroll ('incredibly ancient scroll' when unidentified), which appears to have no practical purpose. It reads:<p>
<table style="clear:both" class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
"My dear cousin, I forbid thee to pick up my ancient armor and fight in my place against Katharamandus. Dare ye not to oppose my will"
The scroll is signed.
It says "Rolf" at the bottom.

Dwarven battle spirits are normally only found when digging up graves here. They have penetrating melee attack and are able to summon additional dwarven battle spirits.<p>

The Ancient Dwarven Key can be used to open the dwarven portal at the bottom of the Sinister Dungeon. Alternatively the Silver Key can be used. Once it has been used to open the dwarven portal, 
it can safely be fed to the Demented Ratling, sacrificed or sold. The portal leads to a four level Ancient Dwarven Dungeon (abbreviation ADD). This dungeon features shifting levels and 
antediluvian enemies. At the bottom, an Antediluvian Dwarven Map Fragment is found, lying on a trap.<p>
