<h3>Bug-Infested Temple</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-3-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Bug-Infested Temple is dangerous area filled with greater claw bugs and killer bugs. 100 PC deaths (or 100 generated PCs) must be recorded in the 'adom.cnt' file before
entry will be allowed (replace contents of the file with four spaces to get entry). The check for access to the temple is made when the character is generated, so if a character
is denied access to the temple, there is no way to gain access later. There are no experience level or other requirements for entry.<p>

The Bug-Infested Temple consists of two parts: bug wilderness (BUGWL) and bug cave (BUGCV). The wilderness part's outer limits are scattered with greater claw bugs.
Around the down staircase, there are eight killer bugs.<p>

Teleportation doesn't work in BUGCV, and digging is limited &ndash; most of the level is diggable, but there are undiggable walls blocking most of the useful digging routes.
See the color map above for about the only useful digging route.<p>

<table class="box"><caption>Bug Temple monster stats</caption><tr><td class="box">
Greater claw bug: Level: 1, DV: 30, PV: 12, Hits: 36, Attacks: 8, Damage: 1d4+6, Speed: 120.<br>
Killer bug: Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 24, Hits: 78, Attacks: 8, Damage: 1d4+12, Speed: 150.
</table>
Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high speed, breed, have multiple attacks and bypass PV. This means that they are what they're called &ndash; killers &ndash; in melee.
Being surrounded by multiple killer bugs can easily prove to be fatal even to very well armored PCs in the late game. They both see in the darkness and see invisible, and are immune
to Mindcraft. Bugs encountered on the top level can be dealt with somewhat safely using missiles; if the PC is powerful enough around the start of the game, they can try to take some bugs
out for some early level boosts. Bolt spells may also be used to attack them from a distance, but are not fully reliable since both types of bugs have some degree of magic resistance
(unlike ADOM 1.1.1). They can safely be delayed using webs, or blocked entirely with doors (especially in the cave level).<p>

Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx and -6 Wi. Eating a killer bug corpse also increases speed, gives +6 Dx and -12 Wi.<p>

In the lower level, the character will find herself immediately surrounded by a huge mob of greater claw bugs. Ball spells, or multiple companions (such as bugs from the upper level),
or similar effects are strongly advised to say the least. The remainder of the cave is filled with secret rooms filled with even more killer bugs. If the correct path (covered by secret doors)
is taken, the PC will arrive at a large hall filled with bugs, as well as statues of various heroes. Destroying these will (thankfully) stop additional bugs from being generated and yield a
number of useful items (although all of these are cursed, which can be remedied).<p>

All the marble statues can be picked up and broken, like normal ones. However, there's another meaning to them; reading. They're in place to
honor the prerelease testing group of ADOM version 1.0.0. Above is a compilation of what they all mean and what you get from them, besides rocks.<p>

Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are all <i>cursed</i>. However, those potions of ultra healing, scrolls of magic
mapping and especially the scrolls of corruption removal are a gift that makes visiting the Bug Cave very worthwhile.<p>

There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an unquestionably famous hero" in honor of Raymond Martineau. No reward for breaking him down, though.<p>

Breaking the center statue and the statue ten tiles west + one north stops the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate line in the accomplishment
list at the end of the game.<p>
