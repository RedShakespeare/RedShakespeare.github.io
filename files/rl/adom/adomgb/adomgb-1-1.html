<h3>Wilderness</h3>
<a href="adomgb-1-1-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The wilderness is the overland map of the Drakalor Chain &ndash; you start the game in the upper right corner of the wilderness, and you may enter a wilderness location
immediately by pressing <tt>&gt;</tt>. It may be useful to learn spells, equip starting items etc. When no monsters are around, a wilderness location may be left with <tt>&lt;</tt>.<p>

The wilderness is often regarded as a curse by new players, whose PCs are killed in wilderness encounters and have difficulty keeping their PCs fed during treks across
the wilderness. Advanced players with PCs who are well equipped to deal with the wilderness regard it as a wonderful resource.<p>

Food consumption is greatly increased while traversing the wilderness (+30 satiation points per turn for Trolls, +15 for other races, can be modified by
'of travelling' armor). All areas in the wilderness have a danger level of 1, unless modified by scrolls of danger. The Survival skill can be useful for lengthy stays
in the wilderness, but note that <tt>a</tt>pplying it wastes a lot of game time.<p>

<h4 id="111">1.1.1 Why start the game in the wilderness?</h4>
Many players will start the game in the wilderness, at least for the first kill, because the first monster killed can be controlled according to what type of wilderness tile
generates an encounter.<p>

<h4 id="112">1.1.2 Strategy and problems in the wilderness</h4>
In order to avoid wasting too much time in the wilderness (e.g. because of the dreadful 90 day limit), it is good to know how long it actually takes to do things in the wilderness
All times are approximate since there are slight variations of some minutes. Being Burdened or Strained does not have any effect on movement time in the wilderness.<p>

<table id="1121" border=1><caption>Wilderness time</caption>
<tr><th>Time Spent <th>Action
<tr><td>nothing    <td>changing body armor, eating
<tr><td>60 min     <td>changing other parts of equipment, drinking, resting
<tr><td>60 min     <td>moving onto plains, road, water, or special tile
<tr><td>90 min     <td>moving onto hills tile
<tr><td>120 min    <td>moving onto forest or water tile without Swimming skill
<tr><td>180 min    <td>moving onto swamp tile
<tr><td>300 min    <td>moving onto mountain tile (provided you own a climbing set)
<tr><td>240 min    <td>applying Survival (Rangers level 1-5 and non-Rangers)
<tr><td>120 min    <td>applying Survival (Rangers level 6-50)
</table><p>

These travel times are modified by seven league boots (around x1/6, x1/3, x2 B/U/C). Occasionally, no time at all will pass when travelling, and the frequency
of this increases as Speed increases. At low speeds, travel times can be multiple times longer. In many cases one turn in wilderness counts as 30 turns elsewhere
(while actual turn count is increased by one). This 30x effect includes:<p>
<ul>
<li>lit torches
<li>sources of HP regeneration, natural HP and PP regeneration
<li>self buffs like Strength of Atlas, Farsight
</ul><p>

However status giving spells like casting Bless or Slow monster on yourself (gaining Blessed, Slowed) will go at 1:1 speed.<p>

Note that the Water breathing intrinsic has no effect on the time needed to move onto a water tile. Likewise, the Climbing skill
and the B/U/C status of a climbing set have no effect on the time needed to move onto a mountain tile. Also note that a climbing set is required to move
onto mountains. It is important to know the status of a climbing set, in particular making sure it is not
cursed. A cursed climbing set will fail at the most inopportune moment. At a minimum, the resulting slip while mountaineering will cause extensive
equipment destruction. It is often fatal. The blessed vs uncursed status seems to have little or no effect.<p>

<h4 id="113">1.1.3 Survival skill</h4>
Successfully applying the Survival skill when not bloated increases the satiation value of the PC by about 100 (equivalent to 1/5 large ration, see
<a href="adomgb-app-G.html">Appendix G</a>). This is roughly tripled for Rangers of level 6 or above. These values hold for both water and land tiles
If the PC is already bloated, her satiation value isn't increased. Instead, she gathers plant seeds (on land tiles) or goes fishing (on water tiles)
The amount of seeds gathered does not depend on terrain type or skill value and averages at about 5.2. Rangers of level 6 or above receive triple amount
When fishing is successful, the PC obtains exactly one piece of fish meat.<p>

The chances of success when applying the Survival skill depend on skill value, terrain type, the Ranger level 6 class power, and the Falcon birthsign
The Falcon birthsign gives a 1/3 chance of success even if you fail the initial check. The following success rates were measured by applying the Survival
skill 100 times, with a skill value of 100. The "normal" column applies to non-Rangers and Rangers of level 1-5, the "high" column to Rangers of level 6-50.
Level is the terrain difficulty level.<p>

<h4 id="114">1.1.4 Wilderness encounters</h4>
The following table specifies chance of a wilderness encounter per step in the wilderness. The Doomed column also applies if the PC is both Cursed and Doomed.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Chance of an encounter</caption>
<tr><th>Terrain  <th>Chance <th>Cursed <th>Doomed
<tr><td>Swamp    <td>18%    <td>48%    <td>90%

Wilderness encounter types are specified next. If the PC is level 25+, the chance is 16.7% for high-level (lvl 25+) encounter, 33% for mid-level (lvl 15+) and 50.3%
for low-level (lvl 1+) encounter. For lvl 15-24 PCs, 33% for mid-level and 67% for low-level encounter. For level and terrain, each of the types has equal chance.<p>

[1] If the Kranach quest is received, PC is max level 5, has max 5000 xp, there is 25% chance of an encounter being a group of roving raiders.<p>

<h4 id="1141">1.1.4.1 Chance for ambush</h4>
After the encounter is generated, 3 possible situations may occur:<p>
<ol>
<li>you are ambushed
<li>you are given choices of <tt>a</tt>mbush, <tt>e</tt>vade, <tt>f</tt>ight
<li>your choices are only <tt>e</tt>vade or <tt>f</tt>ight
</ol><p>

Case 1 cannot happen to invisible PCs, lvl 6+ Druids and lvl 25+ Merchants. For others, there is 3.3% chance to get ambushed, then another 6.7% chance for cursed PCs,
then another 12.5% chance for doomed PCs. This gives about 21% chance if the PC is both cursed and doomed. However, you still avoid ambush if Pe>1d100, or
if Alertness>1d150, or if you have the Scout talent and 10%.<p>

Case 2 will happen if not case 1 and if Stealth+Survival+X &gt; 1d1000, where X = 500 - Level*10 if invisible (yes, being high level is worse here), X = 0 otherwise.<p>

Otherwise case 3.<p>

<h4 id="1142">1.1.4.2 Chance to evade</h4>
Lvl 6+ Druids and Lvl 25+ Rangers evade automatically. Others must pass at least one of the following four checks:<p>
<ol>
<li>Evade chance for an encounter type as in the above table. This chance is tripled if you had a choice of ambush
<li>Evade2 chance for invisible PCs only
<li>Stealth &gt; 1d(200 - Min(Evade,Evade2))
<li>you have the Scout talent and 33%
</ol><p>

<h4 id="115">1.1.5 Weather</h4>
ADOM has command for describing the weather: <tt>:W</tt>, which works in the wilderness only. While in the widlerness you will occasionally receive messages about weather
Most of them can be safely ignored, except the ones which indicate rain. Rain can potentially damage worn/wielded items (rust) or items in backpack (especially scrolls and
books). Backpack can be protected by waterproof blanket and inventory by cloak. Some messages are specific to Silvernight or Darknight. Rangers gain immunity to rain at
character level 6, Elementalists and Druids at level 18, Merchants at level 25.<p>

Rain related messages:<p>
<ul>
<li>The constant rain really is drenching you.
<li>Steady rainfall is slowly drenching the area.
<li>Your cloak prevents you from being completely drenched.
</ul><p>

Silvernight:<p>

<h4 id="116">1.1.6 Unremarkable Cave</h4>
This dungeon is meant to be an easy location for beginners. Entering it is believed to lower the final score. It is two keystrokes away from the starting position (1SW, 1W).
The entrance is labeled as an Unassuming Cave, but deaths show as dying in an Unremarkable Cave (note the difference from Unremarkable Dungeon). Once entered,
it displays the message "You enter a rather unremarkable cave complex. An easy wind is going and you feel that life is rife with new experiences to make!"
The dungeon can be in two different forms. With 30 <span class="newi">3</span> or less character deaths or if in Tutorial mode it comes as one level with a number of
features listed below. With more deaths, it is generated as 3 level dungeon seemingly similar to Village Dungeon (where the only dungeon features are altars and tension rooms).<p>

In Tutorial mode, there is a goblin rockthrower <tt>g</tt> at tunnel entrance, who always drops unidentified potion of healing and scroll of identify, then there
is a special cache with wand of cold, long bow and 40 arrows <tt>}</tt> (SE part after entering tunnel), then a minotaur <tt>M</tt> accross a river, followed by 
random trap <tt>^</tt> in the tunnels after the river, a secret door <tt>#</tt> circumventing the trap, and finally 3x3 room full of goblins <tt>g</tt> in the western part.
It is possible to exit to surface on the western side after crossing the tunnels. New players might want to grab items since having attack
wand and ammunition with long bow can increase survivability.<p>
