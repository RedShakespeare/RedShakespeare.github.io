<h3>Special endings</h3>
Apart from the Ordinary ending, which requires closing the Chaos Gate and then leaving the Drakalor Chain, players may pursue harder types of victory.
Most of them require visiting the Chaos Plane and dealing with Andor Drakon, the ElDeR cHaOs GoD. The Chaos Plane can only be entered by
passing through the Chaos Gate located on D: 50.<p>

<h4 id="41">4.1 Andor Drakon, the ElDeR cHaOs GoD <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/373.png" alt="Andor Drakon, the ElDeR cHaOs GoD" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 80, PV: 50, Hits: 10200, Attacks: 3 <span class="newi">6</span>, Damage: 5d10+24 <span class="newi">6d6+36</span>, Speed: 200.</table>
Andor Drakon is the source of all the trouble in Ancardia. He resides on the ChAoS Plane, which lies beyond the Chaos
Gate. Any PC who wants to attempt a special ending will have to face him. The requirements for passing through the Chaos Gate vary according
to alignment and whether the PC wants to attempt the normal Chaos God ending or an Ultra ending, and are detailed in the sections regarding
the endings.<p>

It is a good idea to remove the chaos artifacts necessary for gate passage immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS Plane. Furthermore, drop them.
They are no longer needed and only serve to further corrupt the PC, which is going to happen rapidly anyway because of the corrupting nature of the
ChAoS Plane. Read all scrolls of corruption removal. Drink all potions of cure corruption.<p>

Andor Drakon is, as might be imagined, a formidable enemy. He is beyond description, as the monster memory states. We'll try to describe him anyway. He is invisible.
He casts what are apparently Death Rays, has a corrupting <big>and penetrating</big> melee attack in addition to the naturally corrupting ChAoS Plane, paralyzes, confuses,
summons (writhing masses of primal chaos and chaos servants are a favorite), casts Darkness, teleports, and drains attributes and power points at a fearsome rate.
Additionally, he sees invisible, sees in darkness, and can pass through walls.<p>

How to deal with him? Have a massively powerful melee attack. Drink all attribute boosting potions prior to gate entry. Be very, very fast, the faster the better,
preferably speed should be intrinsically above 200 and boosted above 400. Have excellent PV and DV. Have every resistance possible &ndash; death ray, paralyzation and
confusion resistances are absolutely necessary. If the PC is not paralyzation resistant, an amulet of free action (or the Boots of the Divine Messenger, for
instance) is essential. A light source is essential. He is vulnerable to demon and humanoid slaying weapons and ammo, and blindness. If the PC sticks with missiles, Andor
Drakon cannot corrupt by touch, paralyze or drain attributes. If the PC is out of direct line, his Death Rays cannot be used.<p>

He has been killed in many different ways, including using the Acid Ball spell. Relying on spells on the ChAoS Plane is not recommended, since Andor Drakon
drains PP very rapidly and claims that using magic strengthens him. In practice casting spells makes him faster (speed +spellcost/5). A wand of fireballs or
crystals of fire are handy for removing the hordes of writhing masses of primal chaos he will probably summon.<p>

Chaotics should avoid prayer on the ChAoS Plane. It causes greater balors to be summoned.<p>

If a PC has much trouble on D: 50, it does not bode well as far as defeating Andor Drakon goes. He often defeats PCs who have <i>no</i>
trouble on D: 50 (but are perhaps not as spoiled as those reading this).<p>

Monsters generated on the ChAoS Plane are: chaos brother, chaos sister, chaos warlord, chaos warrior, corruptor, writhing mass of primal chaos (quadruple chance), chaos plague bearer, chaos rat,
balor, chaos lizard, chaos mutant (double chance), chaos spawn (double chance), chaos wizard, chaos eye.<p>

<h4 id="42">4.2 Chaos God ending</h4>
The Chaos God ending was the first special ending available in ADOM. Today it has become kind of old-fashioned. Victory posts with "ordinary" Chaos Gods
are few and far between. One reason it has fallen out of favor is because the future history of the PC after winning is bleak: after going to all the trouble necessary to
even meet, much less defeat Andor Drakon, the PC revels in glory for some time but is ultimately vanquished by a Champion of Law. Still, it is the only means of
accessing a special ending if Khelavaster cannot be saved, which is very difficult. It is also the only way to achieve a special ending with a pure chaotic: a PC that
starts chaotic and stays that way for the entire game. That in itself is quite an accomplishment.<p>

<h4 id="421">4.2.1 Requirements</h4>
In order to achieve the Chaos God ending the PC must meet several requirements. These are checked during passage through the Chaos Gate. The PC must be C-, must be a crowned Champion
of Chaos, must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted). If these criteria are not met, the PC is shredded to pieces by any of several
guardians or the millions of Chaos denizens Andor Drakon has collected. Furthermore, the PC must have the Chaos Trinity properly equipped: wear the Crown and Medal of Chaos, wield the Sceptre
of Chaos in the right hand, leave the left hand empty. If this requirement is not met, Andor Drakon blasts the PC to oblivion. A successful check results in a message from Andor Drakon
along the lines of "You seem to be wearing the insignia correctly. iT wIlL bE a PlEaSuRe To ShReD yOu In MeLeE!" If all of this is met, the PC winds up on the ChAoS Plane to face Andor
Drakon. Despite the fact that wielding the Sceptre of Chaos is required for Gate entry, it is not necessary for the PC to be wielding it when Andor Drakon is killed (unlike the TotRR in
the Ultra endings below). Since it is a corrupting artifact, it may be wise to discard it immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS Plane.<p>

<h4 id="422">4.2.2 Chaos God ending step by step</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>While chaotic, give six artifacts to the Demented Ratling and get the location of the Stone Circle &ndash; <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#358">3.5.8</a>.
<li>Go to the Stone Circle and kill the multi-headed chaos dragon and get the Crown of Chaos &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-17.html">2.17</a>.
<li>While chaotic, talk to the old crone and give her the following items: a giant boar skull, a scroll of danger,
a potion of cure corruption, a wand of monster creation, and a farmer corpse. Receive the Medal of Chaos &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-1.html#216">2.1.6</a>.
<li>Go to level 66 of the Infinite Dungeon, and get the Sceptre of Chaos &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-2.html#222">2.2.2</a>.
<li>Get crowned as champion of Chaos.
<li>Fight your way to the Chaos Gate on D: 50 &ndash; <a href="adomgb-3-24.html">3.24</a>.
<li>Be extremely corrupted (16 or more corruptions).
<li>While wearing the Crown of Chaos and the Medal of Chaos, and wielding the Sceptre of Chaos, enter the Chaos Gate.
<li>Kill Andor Drakon &ndash; <a href="adomgb-4.html#41">4.1</a>.
</ul><p>

<h4 id="43">4.3 Ultra endings</h4>
For any Ultra ending, the PC needs to have a mythical and long searched-for weapon &ndash; the Trident of the Red Rooster (TotRR). The steps necessary to obtain it are listed below.<p>

All PCs attempting an Ultra ending must procure the Crown of Chaos and Medal of Chaos. In order to receive the quests for the Medal of Chaos from Gaab'Baay the PC must be at some flavor of chaotic
alignment. There are six quests total, the first of which is to "satisfy the mutated one" which refers to completing the Demented Ratling's demand for six artifacts. The Demented Ratling will also
only talk to chaotics. The Demented Ratling reveals the secret of the Stone Circle, where Keriax, the multi-headed haos dragon who holds the Crown of Chaos resides. After receiving the
Medal of Chaos, the PC is free to change alignment, since the Stone Circle can be entered regardless of alignment. Remember the PC must change back to at least some flavor of neutral alignment
in order to retrieve the TotRR. Khelavaster will not summon the TotRR for chaotics.<p>

All of the above has another implication &ndash; the PC cannot be crowned until the Medal of Chaos (or the TotRR itself, if an Ultimate Chaos God ending is planned) is obtained. Fallen
champions will never receive the TotRR nor survive passage through the Chaos Gate, so the nice benefits of crowning must be deferred until the Medal of Chaos or TotRR are obtained.<p>

<h4 id="431">4.3.1 Trident of the Red Rooster <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item660.png" alt="TotRR" align="left">
The Trident of the Red Rooster is the ultimate weapon available. It grants all four elemental immunities, boosts Mana by 24, slays demons and undead, has terrific damage stats and has a number
of other positive effects, making it one of the most powerful weapons in ADOM. It is a two-handed polearm.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
------- Trident of the Red Rooster (+36, 6d12+18) [+12, +12] {Ma+24} -------

Weight: 150s

When wielded it modifies DV by +12 and PV by +12.

When used in melee combat it grants a +36 bonus to hit and causes 6d12+18 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 9d8+16 points of damage.

It is an undead slayer.
It is a demon slayer.
It modifies your mana attribute by +24.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
It grants immunity to fire.
It grants immunity to acid.
It grants immunity to cold attacks.
It grants immunity to shock attacks.
It grants the ability to breathe water.

(allows passage through the Chaos Gate for champions of any alignment)
</pre></table><p>

Retrieving it is a lengthy process outlined below.<p>

<h4 id="4311">4.3.1.1 Filk <tt>p</tt> quest</h4>
The Filk quest is available from the Assassin Prince, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel, once three requirements are met. They are: the PC is at least experience level 45
(Assassins are exception, they must only be at least level 30), the PC has successfully taken Sharad-Waador's quest and slain Srraxxarrakex and the PC has
in her possession the artifact dagger Needle which is one of the rewards Sharad-Waador provides for killing Srraxxarrakex. After receiving the quest, the PC may elect to kill
the Assassin Prince since he carries Needle's companion dagger Sting. Dual-wielded, they are enormously powerful. The object of the quest is to kill Filk, a named quickling bard.<p>

The Assassin Prince gives some cryptic hints provided by the Mad Minstrel about Filk's location. They mean that Filk can be found on the level of the ID corresponding to the
number of first-killed monsters killed. Note that this number can change as the quest proceeds. As a quickling, he is obviously fast, but Filk is the fastest of them all
with a speed of 1500. When attacking Filk, note two things: he has the highest DV of any monster in the game at 500 but a PV of zero. Needless to say he is difficult to hit.
However, once he is hit he is easily killed. He also shares the properties of karmics, although he is not named as such. Use missiles, wands, spells, Mindcraft or companions
to kill him.<p>

<h4 id="4312">4.3.1.2 Mad Minstrel <tt>@</tt></h4>
After the Filk quest is completed, the PC should visit the Mad Minstrel. He will provide access to and information about the location of the Scintillating Cave (found
in the western part of the wilderness south of the RotHK caves very close to the Ruined City).<p>

<h4 id="4313">4.3.1.3 Crumpled scroll <tt>?</tt></h4>
The crumpled scroll is held by the Emperor Moloch on the last level of Scintillating Cave. See section <a href="adomgb-2-20.html#2k2">2.20.2</a> for more details.<p>

<h4 id="4314">4.3.1.4 Khelavaster in Terinyo</h4>
Khelavaster can be found in Terinyo if the PC saves him and is at least level 30. In ADOM v1.x.x, he maintains an invisibility spell on himself; this can be annoying for
PCs lacking the see invisible intrinsic since they may randomly bump into Khelavaster and attack him, which will simultaneously enrage all of the inhabitants of
Terinyo and make the sage himself hostile, which may deny access to the Trident of the Red Rooster. It is possible to calm hostile NPCs, so in practice this disastrous situation may
be salvageable.<p>

When given the crumpled scroll, Khelavaster will summon the TotRR. Remember the PC must be of neutral or lawful alignment.<p>

<h4 id="432">4.3.2 Avatar of Order ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a crowned L+ Champion of Law wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR.
The PC must not be intrinsically Doomed or Cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts. There is no corruption requirement. Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR
is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies, the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the PC, turning her into a miserable ChAoS wretch. Avoid this. ;-)<p>

Note that it is possible for a prospective Avatar of Order to become a fallen champion on the ChAoS Plane, kill Andor Drakon
while wielding the TotRR, and instead become an Avatar of her current alignment, despite not being crowned. This is one way around the corruption requirement for the Avatar of Balance
and UCG endings. However, the PC must be able to change alignment on the ChAoS Plane while fighting Andor Drakon, easier said than done.<p>

<h4 id="433">4.3.3 Avatar of Balance ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a crowned N= Champion of Balance wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. The
PC must not be intrinsically Doomed or Cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts. The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted).
Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies, the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the PC, turning her into a miserable ChAoS
wretch. Avoid this. ;-).<p>

<h4 id="434">4.3.4 Ultimate Chaos God ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a crowned C- Champion of Chaos wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. The
PC must not be intrinsically Doomed or Cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts. The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted).
Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.<p>

<h4 id="435">4.3.5 Ultra endings step by step</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>While chaotic, give six artifacts to the Demented Ratling and get the location of the Stone Circle &ndash; <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#358">3.5.8</a>.

</ul><p>

<div class="resb">
<h4 id="44">4.4 Most stupid follower of ChAoS</h4>
This special victory condition available only to the Chaos Knight class. This ending is achieved by completing the standard 
close the Chaos Gate victory conditions with a Chaos Knight of chaotic alignment. In this case, rather than exiting
the Drakalor Chain and returning as victorious hero, upon handling the second lever, the PC's existence is immediately
snuffed out. Thus players who choose this ending will have no opportunity to return to prior locations or cure corruptions to
improve their final score. A death message accompanying this ending is: "Committed to the ultimate sacrifice by closing the
Chaos Gate thusly ending her existence on level 50 of the Caverns of Chaos." Neutral or lawful Chaos Knights who close the
gate are similarly snuffed out, denying them the corruption free exploration, but receive much happier ending and higher score.
This counts as ordinary ending.<p>
</div>

<div class="newb">
<h4 id="45">4.5 Ultimate ending</h4>
In this ending, the PC leaves Drakalor Chain with the Scroll of Omnipotence in their possession. Step by step:<p>
<ul>
<li>kill no dwarf (except dwarven chaos knights) until meeting Rolf
<li>be lawful to get Rolf's Companion from Dwarven Mystic &ndash; <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#354">3.5.4</a>
<li>talk to Thrundarr about "Rolf", then complete his quests to get Rolf's Savior &ndash; <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#3531">3.5.3.1</a>
<li>get the Weird Fire Starter from the Minotaur Maze until level 30 &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-14.html">2.14</a>
<li>complete the Antediluvian Dwarven Map and meet Rolf (if Troll, Orc, or Dark Elf, be lawful) &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-27.html">2.27</a>
<li>get the Stone Heart from Stone Dragon Caves &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-28.html">2.28</a>
<li>visit ToEF to get the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-5.html">2.5</a>
<li>corrupt the Stone Heart by using it with the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire in inventory &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-29.html">2.29</a>
<li>tame Yggaz by giving him some antediluvian alcohol, lead him to the Ice Queen &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-29.html#2t1">2.29.1</a>, <a href="adomgb-2-22.html">2.22</a>
<li>get the remaining Chaos Orbs and close the Chaos Gate &ndash; <a href="adomgb-3-24.html">3.24</a>
<li>return to surface and use the Weird Fire Starter on dormant volcano to open the Ultimate Dungeon &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-30.html">2.30</a>
<li>kill the Supreme Balor and get the Scroll of Omnipotence &ndash; <a href="adomgb-2-30.html#2u2">2.30.2</a>
<li>leave Drakalor Chain with the Scroll of Omnipotence in your inventory
</ul><p>

Note this ending is impossible to achieve with Chaos Knights, since Rolf will not reveal the Stone Dragon Caves to them, so the artifact Stone
Heart won't be available.<p>

<h4 id="46">4.6 Nihilist ending</h4>
<img src="tiles/item894.png" alt="soe" align="left">
Nihilist ending is a type of "victory" that involves destroying the universe. In terms of points it is about as rewarding as Avatar of Balance ending.
Nihilist ending requires entering the Chaos Gate. This can be accomplished either with the Ordinary Chaos God ending approach, or the Ultra ending approach.
Once on the ChAoS Plane the PC must read a scroll of entropy while standing next to Andor Drakon. This instantly kills him and initiates the ending.<p style="clear:none">

Once Andor has been destroyed, a portal leading back to D: 50 appears. Parts of levels will begin being replaced with black patches of nothingness. Walking
into one of these will result in a death instead of a victory. Revisiting a level the PC has been on since initiating the ending will result in a death
instead of a victory. Each level is only safe to stay on for around 17 turns, although failing to leave after this deadline will still result in a victory.
Teleportation is allowed on all levels, and in practice is necessary to beat the clock. The D: 32 shortcut is not accessible, so ascending all the way
to D: 1 is necessary to observe the ultimate destruction of the Drakalor Chain. The gods can die at any point during the ascent, which prevents any prayers
from working.<p>

Note that it is necessary to close the Chaos Gate in the 17 turns before ascending to D: 49, otherwise the stairs on D: 48 will remain facing downwards and the player
will be trapped.<p>
