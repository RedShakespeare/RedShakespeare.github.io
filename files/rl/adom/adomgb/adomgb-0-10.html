<h3 id="0a">Corruptions</h3>
There is only short, rather cryptic introduction to corruptions in the <a href="adomman-N.html">ADOM Manual</a>. Press <tt>\</tt> to view your corruption status.<p>

<h4 id="0a1">0.10.1 What is corruption?</h4>
Corruption is unavoidable in the Drakalor Chain for any PC who wants to make progress in the game. It is a background process that happens
as a result of the Chaos Gate at the bottom of the Caverns of Chaos being open. Some locations remain free of corruption despite the Chaos Gate
being open, notably those near the surface of the Drakalor Chain. In order to get anything done, however, the PC must descend into corrupting
areas. It is only a matter of time after that until the first corruption occurs. After 90 days of game time elapses, corruption rate doubles.
After the gate is closed, background corruption ceases, which is nice if the PC wants to play tourist for a while.<p>

<!--However, corruption can still be caused by artifacts that corrupt (section <a href="#0a24">0.10.2.4</a>)
as well as corrupting hits from monsters (section <a href="#0a23">0.10.2.3</a>).<p>-->

<h4 id="0a11">0.10.1.1 Definition</h4>
Corruption is the means by which the PC is tainted by the essence of Chaos. They can be corrupted by being damaged by a creature of chaos, triggering a
corruption trap, eating the corpse of a corrupted creature, or local background corruption. A large amount of corruption can also be gained by drinking a
potion of raw chaos, activating a staff of corruption dissemination, or completing certain chaotic quests. Some powerful artifacts of chaos will corrupt 
the PC simply by being in their possession; equipping them will amplify the effect.<p>

Each new corruption means that PC gains new abilities, most of them granting some kind of advantage in exchange for some disadvantage. Some of these abilities
are quite powerful, but beware: if the PC becomes fully corrupted, she will be transformed into a writhing mass of primal chaos, and the game will end.<p>

PCs get one corruption for each 1000 corruption points (CP) they accrue. Any incoming corruption is adjusted by the following factors:<p>
<ul>
<li>*1.3 C- alignment
<li>*0.7 L+ alignment
<li>*0.9 other lawful
<li>*0.9 Unicorn star sign when lawful
<li>*0.9 Druid/Monk lvl 50
<li>*0.7 Farmer/Paladin lvl 50
<li><big>*(100/(90 + Appearance))</big>
<li><big>*0.75/0.5 Chaos Knight lvl 32 with 5/10 corruptions</big>
</ul><p>

Note that the possible corruptions occur in random order (not the order listed on this page) which is decided at the beginning of the game. However, if one or more
corruptions are removed, the RNG is reseeded and the corruptions will reoccur in a new random order.<p>

<div class="resb">
There are a total of 35 different corruptions, but the PC have at most 18 at one time. The corruption pool will always include Poison hands, Mana battery, and Thin and nimble.
Apish look will always be the final corruption. Otherwise, the other corruptions and order of corruptions in the pool is random. However, the 18 corruptions in the pool will
remain the same unless all corruptions are removed.<p>

In addition to the specific special effects of corruptions, with a certain number of corruptions, the PC will get bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, Toughness and Mana, and a
penalty to Willpower, depending on alignment. The gains or losses to such attributes are as follows:
<ul>
<li>if chaotic: (number of corruptions)/2
<li>if neutral: (number of corruptions)/3
<li>if lawful: (number of corruptions)/4
</ul><p>
</div>

<h4 id="0a13">0.10.1.3 Evaluation of corruptions</h4>
Here are provided some comments about the corrupions effects and workarounds:<p>
<ol type="A">
<li><b>You are surrounded by an unholy aura (Ch: -10, DV: +6).</b><br>
Acts mostlly like armor of hate. Causes monsters to become afraid of the PC at more or less random times. In their frightened state, they will flee. A very nasty side effect 
is that shopkeepers become homicidally enraged at PCs that move anywhere near shops with this corruption, fearing that their customers will be frightened away. If the PC has 
any unpaid items when this is triggered then it is classified as a shop robbery, with associated alignment drop and possible Cursing or Dooming. If this happens with Munxip 
or Waldenbrook, the entire town becomes hostile and the PC loses access to local quests. Note that invisible PCs do not suffer the effects of this corruption: monsters that 
cannot see invisible do not detect this corruption. This works for shopkeepers until the "*foo* stares at your position with great intensity" message is generated. After that, 
look out.<p>

<li><b>You rage (DV: -9, +6 melee damage)!</b><br>
Mediocre increase to damage in exchange for losing nine points of DV. Not a very good bargain, especially for low level characters, since this will make them easier to hit
(and some monster hits cause further corruption). Is very good only for melee character with already great DV. It also gives the PC a chance to splatter peaceful monsters they
walk into without a prompt, instead of swapping places with them.<p>

<li><b>Poison drips from your hands.</b><br>
Some players hate this corruption more than any other. PCs with this corruption poison any monsters they engage in melee (a nice effect), turn
any potion they touch (drinking, dipping, throwing, picking up, dropping) into poison (very bad) and curse any food (including herbs) they touch (very bad). It can result in
starvation quickly. The workaround is to wear thick gauntlets, which negate all of the above effects. Gauntlets of Eternal Peace or alchemistic gloves also can negate these
effects when picking up potions or food items, but it is not guaranteed. However, they will <i>never</i> block the effects when drinking potions or eating food. Note that
Poison Hands does not prevent the PC from <tt>U</tt>sing herbs and <tt>a</tt>pplying Alchemy.<p>

<li><b>You have grown thorns (3d3 unarmed damage, Dx: -2, Ap: -3).</b><br>
The extra melee damage occurs only when fighting unarmed. Also bleeding effect is added. Monks and Beastfighters get no benefit. In most cases, other classes should not fight unarmed,
since the damage output and other benefits of most weapons outweigh the damage bonus from this corruption. Thorns do give a good boost to Necromancers' Shadow Touch, which can be used
on weaker monsters after tough fights. Otherwise, useless waste of 2 Dx. When the thorns first grow, the PC suffers 3d3 damage.<p>

<li><b>Your close attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation (+Tele).</b><br>
Very, very nice if the PC has teleport control. Very, very annoying if the PC doesn't have teleport control.<p>

<li><b>You have grown a bulging cranium (Le: +6, Wi: +4, To: -3, Ap: -6, PV: -4).</b><br>
Learning and Willpower increases are nice especially for magic oriented classes. The PV decrease makes any PC more vulnerable to damage and corruption. Not good for looks or Toughness
either.<p>

<li><b>You are a living mana battery.</b><br>
Another nominee for the most hated corruption. All wands and magic staves the PC touches are drained of their charges. This does not destroy them; their final charge can still be
wrenched from them, but extremely annoying nonetheless. Partially charged, unidentified or artifact magic staves are not affected by mana battery and will retain their charges.
There is no workaround. Some side benefits: 1) every time the PC touches a wand with non-zero charges, power points are added to the PC's maximum PP: blessed wands give +2, uncursed +1,
and cursed 0. 2) spell costs are reduced to 80% of their normal cost &ndash; note that this is not cumulative with Darknight / Silvernight reductions, since costs cannot drop below 50%.
3) PP regeneration is increased (if you aren't already gaining PP from another source (like Concentration), you have a 10% chance of gaining 1 PP). Curiously, wands that the PC sells
while this corruption is active are priced per their existing charges, but are drained of charges after they are sold. Picking up a wand with charges in a shop will lower the value of
the wand, and the shopkeeper will blame the PC for damage.<p>

<li><b>You have grown horns (+2 melee damage, Ap: -4).</b><br>
Melee damage in exchange for Appearance. The bonus is +2 for weapons or +3 for unarmed combat.<p>

<li><b>Your antennae explore the details of your environment (Ap: -4).</b><br>
Kicks in quasirandomly (1/250 chance every turn) to reveal a bit of the dungeon layout in the immediate vicinity (radius 7 + NumberOfCorruptions/2), as indicated by the message
"You suddenly know more about your environment.". Loss of Appearance. It provides a means of locating hidden dungeon features such as royal vaults without using any items.<p>

<li><b>Your skin is covered by tough scales (PV: +8, Dx: -6, Ap: -4).</b><br>
Nice PV increase, nasty Dexterity decrease, loss of Appearance.<p>

<li><b>You have grown 10 extra eyes (Ap: -6, Pe: +6).</b><br>
Nice Perception increase, loss of Appearance. May speed up recovery from light traps.<p>

<li><b>You exhale sulphur (Ch: -4).</b><br>
This enables the PC to spit a corrosive acid for satiation, much the same as a Drakeling's racial ability. Definitely beneficial corruption except for Drakelings.<p>

<li><b>You look somewhat apish (St: +3, Le: -1, Wi: -1, Ch: -2, Ap: -3).</b><br>
This corruption's effects reoccur periodically. Maximum is set at beggining of game, 1d10+4. Its effects are cumulative over time, so the PC keeps gaining Strength while losing
Learning, Willpower, Charisma, and Appearance. At some point it also starts decreasing Dexterity and increasing Toughness. The game notifies you when this is happening with the
phrase "You suddenly remember your ancestors." Nice for fighter types, nasty for spellcasters.
<big>Apish look can only be obtained if the PC is 'extremely corrupted', as their 18th corruption. Consequently, a Chaos Knight can never start out with the corruption.</big><p>

<li><b>Your corrupted tissue seems to heal much faster.</b><br>
Another corruption causing cumulative effects. The PC heals faster (1 HP every 5 turns), but the process leaves scars (every 1000 HP healed by corruption) which reduce both
Dexterity and Appearance by one point for each scar. Scars do not disappear when the corruption is removed, and can only be removed by <tt>u</tt>sing gelee royal. Nasty over time.<p>

<li><b>Your feet have been transformed into hooves (+8 kicking damage, Dx: -6).</b><br>
Nasty loss of Dexterity, especially since most PCs aren't kickers anyway, but useful for Monks. Helps Monks kicking down walls and everyone kicking down doors.<p>

<li><b>Your muscles have stiffened slowing you down (base action cost: 1500 energy points, PV: +4, St: +2).</b><br>
Very, very bad, possibly the worst. Slows down all your movement by 1.5x &ndash; should be removed immediately.<p>

<li><b>You have become extremely thin and nimble (1/2 weight, DV: +6).</b><br>
Nice corruption. Six points of DV, but increases hunger by 1 per turn. This is one of the corruptions needed to enter the Quickling Tree, except for Hurthlings and Mist Elves.<p>

<li><b>You have become very light (1/10 weight, Dx: +4, St: -6, To: -6, Ap: -6, Speed: +20).</b><br>
Bad Strength, Toughness and Appearance losses in exchange for speed and Dexterity. It should be noted that despite its advantages, high speed significantly lowers experience gains.
This is the corruption needed to enter the Quickling Tree, for everyone.
</ol>

<div class="resb">
<span class="credit">Credit ADOM Wiki &ndash; <a href="http://ancardia.wikia.com/wiki/Corruptions">Corruptions</a>.</span>
<ol type="A" start="19">
<li><b>Your blood turned to acid. (=Acid)</b><br>
Provision of an elemental immunity and the potential to blind attackers makes it very desirable. It may even 
save a character's life, if they are engaged in melee while paralyzed and/or by a monster with multiple attacks.
But, blind monsters with the teleporting ability will teleport every time they move, making them hard to track. 
Cats can kill themselves by attacking the PC.<p>

<li><b>You sport a babbling mouth on your forehead that rants and raves dark secrets (Le: +8, Pe: -4, Ch: -6, Ap: -6).</b><br>
At random intervals, the mouth screams a formula that invokes the same effect as a wand of wonder, ie. casts a random spell 
and slightly increases the knowledge of that spell. The effect seems to have a 1/1000 chance of occurring at each turn.
Once activated, it depletes all of the PP. This may prove very frustrating and even dangerous for PCs heavily relying
on their own magic. It does have the additional benefit of training Mana quite quickly without draining own spell base.
Very unfortunate accidents, like unexpectedly attacking an adjacent NPC with a ball spell, can occur.
It also makes the PC automatically fail all Stealth checks, and prevents the PC from getting the Weird Tome from the Ghost Librarian.<p>

<li><b>Your eyes turned black (Pe: +3, +SeeI).</b><br>
Grants the see invisible intrinsic, in addition to extra Perception. One of three corruptions with no negative effects whatsoever 
(the other being acid blood, and thriving on the flesh of order).<p>

<li><b>You sweat blood. (Ch: -2, Ap: -4, Speed: +5)</b><br>
A decent tradeoff of attributes, since extra speed is beneficial for most situations.<p>

<li><b>Your bones are made from bronze (Dx: -2, DV: -2, PV: +3).</b><br>
A fair exchange of dodging abilities for protection. Certainly not one of the most dangerous corruptions.<p>

<li><b>You are attached to ChAoS corrupting your foes.</b><br>
Melee attacks inflicting corruption on monsters is almost universally undesirable. A monster that poses little threat to begin with 
may be transformed into a writhing mass of primal chaos; the corrupting touch actually heals chaos monsters like WMoPCs. The effect 
is usually not complete absorption &ndash; the enemy will suffer damage, and most corrupting monsters will recover just a small amount &ndash;
but non-lethal hits will completely heal WMoPCs. PCs depending on melee should thus remove it immediately, especially if acquired on D: 50.<p>

<li><b>The voice of ChAoS whispers disturbing secrets into your thoughts (Le: +4, Ma: +2, Wi: -6).</b><br>
Willpower is usually easier to train than Learning by using herbs, so it is generally a good tradeoff; neither greatly 
beneficial nor very dangerous.<p>

<li><b>Your blood is freezingly cold (Dx: -2, Ap: -1, Speed: -10).</b><br>
PCs with cold blood will slow down dramatically when cold and speed up greatly at the cost of taking damage when hot. 
Drakelings get no benefits at all from the corruption; they may want to remove the corruption to regain speed right away, though 
compared to some other corruptions it is somewhat tolerable. For other PCs, while the speed penalty is undesirable, the 
temperature-related effects can be positive as well as negative.<p>

<li><b>Your bodily tissues seem to be in a state of decay requiring a lot of will to stay up (Wi: +10, St: -5, Ap: -5, Speed: -10).</b><br>
In addition to causing quite dramatic attribute changes, the corruption also halves all HP regeneration for the PC.
Though the Willpower boost may be of benefit to Mindcrafters and mages wielding ball spells, the disadvantages are 
likely to significantly nuisance them without adequate strategies to compensate the loss of mobility and carrying capacity.
The regeneration penalty is definitely very undesirable to all, making this corruption one of the worst.<p>

<li><b>You thrive on the flesh of Order.</b><br>
Eating the corpse of a lawful being gives a speed bonus of 1d100 points, that decays by 1 point per turn. The usefulness 
is limited by the facts that very few monsters in the game are lawful (blink dogs being one notable example). One of the three 
only positive corruptions, with weakest effect.<p>

<li><b>You sport gills (Ap: -3, +WBre).</b><br>
Very desirable corruption with only a minor downside. Water breathing is a quite difficult intrinsic to obtain, and it allows 
the PC to cross any river and even the Water Dragon Cave without taking any damage.<p>

<li><b>You hate the sun and try to blot it.</b><br>
Occasionally forces the PC to replicate the effect of the Darkness spell. With no light sources, this corruption can become 
very annoying and the player might want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. It is especially dangerous in places where 
there is no reason to cast Darkness anyway &ndash; such as Terinyo or Dwarftown where the PC can thus accidentally attack unseen
civilians, or in shops. Can be deadly to Doomed characters.<p>

<li><b>Your flesh continually spouts disease-ridden maggots (To: -6, Ch: -2, Ap: -4, DV: +4).</b><br>
At random intervals a tame (brown/green/purple/red/white) worm will spawn from your body, causing a few points of damage.
Though companions can be put to tactical uses by some players, the Toughness loss afflicted on the PC by the corruption is a very 
significant problem for many of them.<p>

<li><b>Your frontal eyes have merged to form one larger eye (Pe: +4, Ch: -2, Ap: -2).</b><br>
Note that the positive part of the corruption will not occur if PC is wearing helmet, which limits its usefulness. In addition to the attribute modifiers, 
it also gives a -1 penalty to melee to-hit and a -4 penalty to missile to-hit.<p>

<li><b>Your eyes are shrouded by the mists of ChAoS (Pe: -10, +SeeI).</b><br>
Though it grants a quite useful intrinsic, there are quite a few other less harmful means of acquiring it. The significant 
loss of Perception is likely to have a noticeably serious impact on visibility range; additionally, if Perception falls as low as 1,
the number of turns required to find a secret door/passageway by <tt>s</tt>earching increases dramatically.<p>

<li><b>Your legs have stretched into long, fragile stilts (Ap: -6, PV: -4, base movement cost: -25% energy points, -4 kicking damage).</b><br>
Kind of like the opposite of the stiff muscles corruption, this corruption exchanges some PV and Appearance for increased mobility &ndash; quite a
desirable tradeoff overall.<p>

<li><b>Your mouth has turned into a writhing mass of prehensile tentacles (Dx: +6, Ap: -15).</b><br>
Great gain in Dexterity, but a huge loss in Appearance. Since Appearance determines resistance to corruption,
the latter means that the PC can be corrupted much more easily after getting this. The most serious effect of the corruption is its
effect on spellcasting &ndash; attempting to cast a spell can cause it fail and waste a turn. Characters wishing to cast spells will
need to remove this immediately. Trying to chat with NPCs also fails very frequently, but can be done with enough persistence and is usually
not a major problem anyway. This corruption seems to prevent the PC from getting the Weird Tome from the Ghost Librarian even if speaking
succeeds on the first try. The failure rate depends on Willpower, ranging from 95% at 1 Willpower to 33% at 99.
</ol><p></div>

<h4 id="0a2">0.10.2 Gaining corruptions</h4>
The game keeps track of corruption with a numerical value which increments each time twenty turns pass in a corrupting zone. For each 1000 corruption points (CPs),
the PC gains one corruption <big>only if Appearance = 10, otherwise 910 CPs for Ap=1 and 1890 CPs for Ap=99</big>. The amount required to corrupt the PC to death is
19 corruptions (the 19th corruption doesn't actually occur &ndash; instead, the PC is transformed and game ends). 180 points equals 1% corruption and the PC gains
a new corruption each time they pass a multiple of 1000/180 = 5.556%. This is a strict rule only up to 99% corruption. The 99% corruption level begins at 99 * 180 = 17820
corruption points, but the PC is given extra leeway at this point and does not transform into a chaos creature until the counter is over 19000 points.<p>

<div class="resb">PCs with lower Appearance acquire corruptions at a faster rate. This means that previously inconsequential Appearance losses now make certain
corruptions more detrimental. Also, because about 1 in 2 corruptions reduce Appearance, they cause a cumulative acceleration of acquisition of new corruptions.

<span class="credit">Credit Vladimir Panteleev.</span>
As mentioned above, the PC must eventually enter areas where background corruption occurs. Areas with no corruption flag set:<p>
<ul>
<li>Small Cave before day 90
<li>Unremarkable Dungeon
<li>Dusty Dungeon lvls 1-2
<li>Village Dungeon
<li>Druid Dungeon
<li>Puppy Cave
<li>Caverns of Chaos lvls 1-9
<li>Infinite Dungeon lvls 1-9
<li>Wilderness
<li>Gremlin Cave
<li>Dwarven Graveyard
<li>Water Dragon Cave
<li>Greater White Unicorn Glade
<li>Terinyo
<li>Lawenilothehl
<li>High Mountain Village
<li>Old Barbarian's Glade
<li>Mad Minstrel's Clearing
</ul><p>

Otherwise, the corruption points (CPs) gained depend on a Danger Level (DL) in particular area. Refer to section <a href="adomgb-app-L.html">Appendix L</a> for the list of
areas and their DLs.<p>

No other corruption occurs if:<p>
<ul>
<li>the current level has the NoCorruption flag set (see the list above)
<li>DL&lt;10
<li>the Chaos Gate is closed
</ul><p>

The background corruption is applied once every N turns. If the PC is Doomed, that's TWICE every N turns:<p>

if (TurnNumber mod N=0) or (Doomed and (TurnNumber mod N=1)) then<p>

(this is how mathematicians/programmers say once normally and twice with Doomed intrinsic per N turns)<p>

N is calculated based on the DL the PC is on:<p>
<ul>
<li>ID: N=CorruptionSpeed[ Max(Min(90,CurrentIDLevel)-10,0)/20 ]
<li>I66: N=20
<li>levels with Danger Level&gt;40: N=CorruptionSpeed[ (DangerLevel-5)/10 ]
<li>other N=CorruptionSpeed[ (DangerLevel-10)/10 ]
</ul><p>

CorruptionSpeed is a 5-element array:<p>
<ul>
<li>CorruptionSpeed[0]=20
<li>CorruptionSpeed[1]=15
<li>CorruptionSpeed[2]=10 <big>12</big>
<li>CorruptionSpeed[3]= 5 <big>9</big>
<li>CorruptionSpeed[4]= 2 <big>6</big>
</ul><p>

Put in words, N can be 2 <big>6</big>, 5 <big>9</big>, 10 <big>12</big>, 15, or 20. The smaller N, the faster the corruption (corruption occurs every N turns,
or twice the N turns if Doomed). In the Infinite Dungeon, N is 20 for levels I:10-29, 15 for levels
I:30-49, 10 <big>12</big> for levels I:50-69, 5 <big>9</big> for levels I:70-89, and 2 <big>6</big> for levels I:90 and above. The exception is level I:66
(the special SIL level with MaLaKaI) where N is 20. For other areas, N is 20 for DL 10-19, 15 for DL 20-29, 10 <big>12</big> for DL 30-39, 5 <big>9</big> for DL 40-44,
and 2 <big>6</big> for DL 45 and above.<p>

If the background corruption is to be applied on this turn:<p>
<ul>
<li>1 CP is always applied
<li>if the current level is in the CoC and DL&gt;=45, +2 CP
<li>ChAoS Plane: +1d100 CPs
<li>Emperor Moloch's level: +1d33 CPs
</ul><p>

Now, there's a bug <big>(fixed)</big> in the corrupting code. This is how it SHOULD have worked:<p>
<ul>
<li>+1 CP if it's beyond day 90
<li>+2 CP if it's beyond day 180 (cumulative with previous)
<li>+3 CP if it's beyond day 270 (cumulative with previous)
<li>+4 CP if it's beyond day 360 (cumulative with previous)
</ul><p>

However, only the first line is executed &ndash; the 90-day limit.<p>

Being L+ decreases corruption by -30%, L or LN -10 %, C- enhances corruption by +30%, lawful Unicorn-borns -10%, lvl50 Farmers and lawful Paladins -30%, lvl50 Monks
and Druids -10%.<p>

Note that since background corruption is applied only by 1-2 points, the above do not affect its speed, but major corruptions, such as eating
chaotic corpses etc. The "crowned as champion" status does not affect corruption speed.<p>

Note that a corrupting level can be made less so, or even completely noncorrupting, by reading scrolls of peace. These reduce the danger
level, and thus the corruption rate of the current level. Bless the scrolls before reading them. The number of scrolls required depends on
the level. If Dwarftown is generated on D: 10 or D: 11, for instance, reading a blessed scroll of peace will probably stop corruption. On
the other hand, if it is necessary to stop corruption on a particular level of the Blue Dragon Caves, approximately nine scrolls of peace are required.<p>

<h4 id="0a22">0.10.2.2 Corruption traps <tt>^</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/trap_c.png" alt="corruption trap" align="left">
Corruption traps are as common as any other trap in the dungeons. They cause 10d10 CPs. They are purple when revealed.<p>

<h4 id="0a23">0.10.2.3 Corrupting hits from monsters</h4>
Some monsters corrupt by hitting the PC in melee. Common ones include chaos brothers, chaos sisters and the grues found in
the elemental temples. <a href="adomgb-app-J.html">Appendix J</a> contains a complete list.<p>

<h4 id="0a24">0.10.2.4 Artifacts which corrupt</h4>
<h4 id="0a241">0.10.2.4.1 Moon Sickle <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item199.png" alt="moon sickle" align="left">
This unique corrupting artifact corrupts only if it hits successfuly (2d3 CPs). It is guaranteed to be found moderately deep in the CoC. Read more about it in section
<a href="adomgb-3-6.html#365">3.6.5</a>.<p>

<h4 id="0a242">0.10.2.4.2 When carried</h4>
The following artifacts contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption and will corrupt the PC merely by carrying them:<p>
<ul>
<li>Black Tome of Alsophocus (random artifact) <tt>"</tt>
<li>Boots of Great Speed (found in the Quickling Tree) <tt>[</tt>
<li>Shield of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's first quest) <tt>[</tt>
<li>Amulet of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's second quest) <tt>'</tt>
<li><span class="newi">Chainmail of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's third quest) <tt>[</tt></span>
<li>Spear of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's fourth quest, if you can get it) <tt>(</tt>
<li>Sceptre of Chaos (part of Chaos trinity, found in SIL (I:66)) <tt>(</tt>
<li>Medal of Chaos (part of Chaos trinity, summoned by Gaab'Baay) <tt>'</tt>
<li>Crown of Chaos (part of Chaos trinity, found in the Stone Circle) <tt>[</tt>

The Black Tome of Alsophocus teaches the PC random spell, or improves knowledge in a known spell if read successfully. It grants 20 CPs per
turn spent reading (base PP cost of the spell + 3), but min 200 and max 6666. The corrupting artifacts provide about 1/2 CP per turn when in backpack,
and almost 1 CP per turn when equipped. The effects are cumulative. Of course more corruption is applied when successfully used (spear &amp; sceptre).<p>

<h4 id="0a243">0.10.2.4.3 When used</h4>
All of the Chaos Orbs fall into this category, however, there is a great deal of difference in the amount of corruption caused by using the different Chaos Orbs.<p style="clear:both">

<table border=1><caption>Corruption caused by using the Chaos Orbs</caption>
<tr><th>Chaos Orb <th>CPs  <th>Effect              <th>Tile
<tr><td>Water     <td>600  <td>full HP             <td><img src="tiles/item302.png" alt="water">

<tr><td>Mana      <td>5000 <td>full PP; +10 max PP; +3 Ma<td><img src="tiles/item612.png" alt="mana">
</table><p>

Note that if a PC is wearing Elemental Gauntlets when the Orbs are used, the above corruption points are halved.<p>

<h4 id="0a25">0.10.2.5 Potions of raw chaos <tt>!</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item610.png" alt="porc" align="left">
Logically enough, if the PC drinks a potion of raw chaos it will cause corruption (50d5/50d10/50d30 CPs B/U/C). They can also corrupt, however,
if the PC tries to use them to polymorph an item by dipping it in the potion. There is a chance the potion will explode, which causes 100d100 CPs as
well as 10d30 damage. Dipping in potions of raw chaos will not make wands of wishing or rings of djinni summoning &ndash; section <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e4">0.14.4</a>.<p>

<h4 id="0a26">0.10.2.6 Tracts of chaos <tt>"</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item680.png" alt="toc" align="left">
Tracts of chaos grant corruption, ~100 CPs per reading &ndash; section <a href="adomgb-0-2.html#026">0.2.6</a>.<p>

<h4 id="0a27">0.10.2.7 From pools <tt>0</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/pool.png" alt="pool" align="left">
Drinking from pools may result in the message "You feel corrupted!" (1/52 chance). Self-explanatory, DLd30 CPs. Additionally, a pool inside Stone Circle
causes massive corruption (10d100 CPs) per sip.<p>

<h4 id="0a28">0.10.2.8 From corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item103.png" alt="corpse" align="left">
Some corpses will corrupt the PC if eaten. Obvious ones include the corpses of the Chaos Orb guardians. Others include Keethrax, Keriax
and chaos animals. The effects won't be compiled here. You can browse <a href="adomgb-app-J.html">Appendix J</a> or section <a href="adomgb-0-3.html#0335">0.3.3</a>
for corruptions resulting from eating monster corpses.<p>

<h4 id="0a29">0.10.2.9 From quests</h4>
Riurry will reward the PC with 1-2 corruptions for killing the Greater White Unicorn Yrruir. <big>Chaos Diplomat will reward the PC with 1-2 corruptions for killing the
Ice Queen.</big><p>

<h4 id="0a2a">0.10.2.10 Being crowned a champion of chaos</h4>
Being crowned a champion of chaos will cause 2-3 immediate corruptions. Additionaly, 75% of demons will be generated neutral to crowned chaotics.<p>

<h4 id="0a3">0.10.3 Removing corruptions</h4>
There will be a time when your PC wants to remove one or more corruptions. Some corruptions are very troublesome and worth getting rid of immediately. Later in
the game, removing corruptions may be necessary simply to extend the life of the PC. Whatever the reason, a thorough knowledge of how to remove corruptions
should be part of every experienced player's repertoire. There are several ways of doing this as outlined below. Corruption removal items are among the most
precious in the game. They should always be blessed unless the PC is trying to specifically remove only one corruption that is impossible to deal with (poison
hands can be impossible to deal with without thick gauntlets) while preserving others (for instance one needed to enter the Quickling Tree).<p>

<h4 id="0a31">0.10.3.1 Potions of cure corruption <tt>!</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item538.png" alt="pocc" align="left">
Potions of cure corruption are exactly what the name implies &ndash; they remove corruption, approximately 0.75 corruptions for each blessed potion of cure
corruption the PC drinks. A potion of cure corruption is also a quest object for Gaab'Baay. Beware of cursed potions of cure corruption. They cause corruption rather
than curing it.<p>

Blessed potions of cure corruption remove 50d30 CPs, uncursed remove 50d10 CPs, cursed add 50d5 CPs.<p>

<small>
The Ice Queen will reward the PC with 4 potions for completing her first quest. The Minotaur Emperor will drop (among other rewards) up to 4 potions when killed.

<h4 id="0a311">0.10.3.1.1 Obtaining PoCCs from Guth'Alak</h4>
<img src="tiles/285.png" alt="guth'alak" align="left">
Potions of cure corruption can be obtained from the druid Guth'Alak in Terinyo. He will reward a non-chaotic PC with a potion of cure corruption for delivering
a greater chaos creature's or highly corrupted creature's corpse to him.<p>

He will provide potion of corruption for the corpse of the following monsters:<p>
<ul>
<li>Snake from Beyond <tt>s</tt>
<li>Master Summoner <tt>@</tt> (Yulgash)
<li>Ancient Stone Beast <tt>F</tt>
<li>Ancient Chaos Wyrm <tt>W</tt>
<li>Greater Black Unicorn <tt>U</tt> (Riurry)
<li>Chaos Archmage <tt>@</tt> (Nuurag-Vaarn)
<li>black unicorn <tt>U</tt> (the only non-unique)
<li>Black Druid <tt>@</tt> (Keethrax)
<li>Emperor Moloch <tt>&amp;</tt>
<li>Multi-headed Chaos Dragon <tt>W</tt> (Keriax)
<li><big>Minotaur Emperor <tt>M</tt></big>
</ul><p>

If the PC is chaotic, it is a good idea to sell a chaos creature's corpse to Munxip for safekeeping, then buy it back at a later time when the PC is non-chaotic.
It can then be traded to Guth'Alak for a potion of cure corruption.<p>

<h4 id="0a32">0.10.3.2 Scrolls of corruption removal <tt>?</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item339.png" alt="socr" align="left">
Scrolls of corruption removal were called scrolls of chaos resistance in ADOM 1.1.1 and earlier.
Blessed scrolls of corruption removal remove about 1.5 corruptions per reading. There are several places where scrolls of corruption removal can be obtained: the
only absolutely guaranteed location is the hidden room in the High Mountain Village. This will always contain one scroll of corruption removal, although
beware &ndash; it is always cursed. Khelavaster will give six scrolls of corruption removal to a PC that manages to save him. The Dwarven Mystic in Dwarftown
may give four blessed scrolls of corruption removal to neutral PCs. The Bug Temple has three cursed scrolls of corruption removal. Finally, the Mad Minstrel will reward
a PC who brings him the Weird Tome with five cursed scrolls of corruption removal. Beware of cursed scrolls of corruption removal. They cause corruption rather
than curing it.<p>

Blessed scrolls of corruption removal remove 100d30 CPs, uncursed remove 100d10 CPs, cursed add 100d5 CPs. Thus cursed SoCRs are twice as bad as cursed PoCCs, while
blessed SoCRs are twice as good as blessed PoCCs. The implications should be obvious: never drink or read any cursed corruption removal item, and bless
SoCRs in any but a dire emergency.<p>

<h4 id="0a33">0.10.3.3 Tracts of order <tt>"</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item682.png" alt="too" align="left">
Reading a tract of order amounts to an appeal to the lawful god for corruption removal &ndash; section <a href="adomgb-0-2.html#026">0.2.6</a>.
The amount of corruption removed is around 100 CPs. Tracts of order are most useful to get rid of an annoying corruption as soon as it occurs, thus
reseeding the RNG and hopefully avoiding it the next time a PC receives a corruption.<p>

<h4 id="0a34">0.10.3.4 Yrruir <tt>U</tt> &ndash; the greater white unicorn quest</h4>
<img src="tiles/308.png" alt="yrruir" align="left">
Yrruir will remove all corruption <b>once</b> as a reward for the PC killing the Greater Black Unicorn &ndash; Riurry. It is wise to wait to use this cleansing until
it is absolutely necessary. If the PC is doing a normal ending, this should ideally be the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor Chain to
ensure a corruption-free ending, which leads to better scores and a happier future history for the PC after the game is finished.<p>

<div class="newb">
<h4 id="0a35">0.10.3.5 Staff of purification <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item767.png" alt="staff of purification" align="left">
Staves of purification are very useful for dealing with corruption. They recharge fast enough to offset background corruption and the odd corrupting melee hit, and 
can be used outside of corrupting areas to remove any amount of corruption, given enough time. Unfortunately, they are unable to remove corruption while the PC has 
the Mana battery corruption. If corruption is a problem, a staff of purification is worth a wish.<p>
