<h3 id="0c">Powers</h3>
Powers in ADOM are intrinsics, status conditions and item powers. Status conditions differ from intrinsics, as intrinsics are usually permanent unless/until they are removed
(by removing an item if granted by one; or by magical means such as pools or karma). Also, status conditions appear in the bottom left of the game screen; whilst intrinsics
can usually only be identified by a potion of insight or the Revelation spell. Item powers are magical properties of certain items, usually artifacts.<p>

<h4 id="0c1">0.12.1 Intrinsics</h4>
Intrinsics are properties conferred on the player by worn item (and only stay in effect as long as the corresponding items are equipped) or received permanently from eaten corpse,
pool or certain other means. Intrinsics generally provide resistance against certain forms of attack or confer other benefits. A few intrinsics, notably cursing and dooming, are
undesirable and are generally removed as soon as possible. Note that the effects of most intrinsics stack — that is, two counts of fire resistance is better than one; two counts of
dooming is worse than one. Also note that items that provide elemental resistances or immunities cannot be destroyed by the corresponding element, even if an item's material usually
makes it susceptible to that element (eg. rings of fire resistances will never burn despite being made of wood).<p>

There is no command to view your intrinsics. You have to find a way to see them in game. The available methods are:<p>
<ul>
<li>drink a potion of insight
<li>cast the Revelation spell
<li>intrinsics are revealed upon death
</ul><p>

<h4 id="0c11">0.12.1.1 Resistances</h4>
There are various resistances available. These are:<p>
<ul>
<li>damage types: fire, cold, acid, shock
<li>special attacks: paralysis, petrification, poison, confusion, death rays, sleep, stun, sickness
</ul><p>

Remember that resistance does <i>not</i> equal immunity in ADOM, ie. being hit by a Death Ray while resistant will not kill you instantly, but will still deal a
significant amount of damage. Nevertheless two of the resistances don't have any levels, they equal immunities in effect: petrification and sleep. Some of
the resistances can be gained by eating an appropriate monster corpse: intrinsic fire resistance can be gained by eating the corpse of fire-related creatures.
The game generates messages related to this:<p>
<ul>
<li>fire beetle (50% chance of gaining fire resistance): You suddenly feel very hot! (whether or not resistance has actually been granted)
<li>fire lizard (10% chance of gaining fire resistance): You suddenly shiver. (fire resistance granted) This stuff cools you down! (fire resistance not granted)
<li>larger fire creatures, fire drakes, red dragons, and red wyrms, grant fire resistance every time
</ul><p>

There are further considerations about fire resistance in the Tower of Eternal Flames. See section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#251">2.5.1</a> for more explanation.<p>
<ul>
<li>cold resistance can be gained by eating white dragons, white wyrms, ice lizards, or frost salamander/frost giant corpses
<li>acid resistance can be gained by eating ankheg, ant, black dragon or black wyrm corpses
<li>shock resistance can be gained by eating lightning lizard, blue dragons or blue wyrms corpses
<li>poison resistance can be gained by eating giant centipede, cave fisher, tarantula, snake, viper, cobra, spider, or dark elven corpses. Be aware that most of
this both poisons the PC and grants resistance, so the PC will have to endure a brief period of poisoning
<li>petrification resistance can be gained by eating gorgon corpse (but the PC should have it already by other means, else is risking death)
<li><big>paralyzation resistance can be gained by eating gelatinous cube corpse (1/3 chance)</big>
</ul><p>

An interesting test conducted by Petri Sihvola regarding petrification by a gorgon's breath:
<pre>
> I did some testing and there's an approximate 50% chance of dying to a gorgon breath without resistance. However, if DV is high enough
> the chance is drastically reduced. This one shows my DV and how many times I died:
> DV:23 10/20
> DV:44 8/20
> DV:53 1/20
> DV:69 0/20
</pre><p>

<h4 id="0c12">0.12.1.2 Immunities</h4>
Immunity to the four basic damage types is possible: fire, cold, acid and shock. Immunity means that the PC will take no damage from the corresponding elemental
attack. However, creatures which deal elemental damage can still harm the PC, due to their ability to deal physical damage. The PC is only immune to damage from
the elemental attack. <span class="newi">Sickness immunity was added.</span><p>

<h4 id="0c13">0.12.1.3 Dooming and Cursing</h4>
Basically, Cursed and Doomed intrinsics decrease Luck, which is a hidden property. See section <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#064">0.6.4</a> for
details.<p>

Dooming or Cursing, as might be expected from the names, is generally to be avoided. They result from robbing shops, by drinking from pools,
attacking karmic creatures in melee, reading scrolls of ill fate, cursing monster attacks (green hag, annis hag, black wizard, black druid),
or eating certain corpses:<p>
<ul>
<li>Cursing only: ancient dwarf, annis hag, green hag, quasit
<li>Dooming only: least/lesser/greater daemon, Cat Lord
<li>both: Cute Dog, dwarven child, Oracle, Priest, royal guardian, (greater) white unicorn
</ul><p>

Cursing makes the game nudge all the die-rolls against the PC, generate more monsters which hit harder while the PC's hits become weaker.
Dooming is a more severe form of this. Dooming also increases background corruption rate, and makes it much more difficult to pray for divine help.<p>

Nevertheless, there are ways to exploit these intrinsics. These techniques are not for the beginner, of course. Vaults and wilderness encounters
become more common. If the PC wants to achieve Grand Mastery in a weapon class, becoming Cursed and/or Doomed in the wilderness is the only way to
do it in a reasonable time frame.<p>

Dooming and Cursing can be removed by sacrificing at a coaligned altar. It may take considerable sacrificing to remove the Cursed/Doomed
intrinsics, since they are only removed at the "very close" level of piety. Praying while the PC is already at very close status also may
remove Dooming and/or Cursing, although these intrinsics make it more difficult to appeal for divine assistance, as noted above. Removing Dooming
(only) results in the message "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you." Removing Cursing (only) results in the message "You feel relieved."
Removing both Cursing and Dooming simultaneously results in only the "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you." message.<p>

Another trick for exploiting the Doomed state is as follows: if a PC finds an altar early in the game, ideally before the Si level so that zero or
very few artifacts have been generated, the PC should purchase or acquire plenty of food (cooked lizards and/or stomafillia herbs), become Doomed by
eating a dooming corpse (daemons and quasits spring to mind) or wearing a ring of doom, and then exploit the heavy monster generation by sacrificing
the monsters on the altar. This can quickly lead to very close or even extremely close status. After the Dooming is removed, by removing a cursed
ring of doom or through reaching very close status, the PC can be crowned or precrowned.<p>

Dooming also has an effect in dark rooms: if a Doomed PC wanders into a dark room, there is 2% chance for an instakill "You are likely to be eaten by a grue."
(this only applies to Doomed characters). Deliberately playing in a Cursed or Doomed state is dangerous and should be reserved for those players who know
exactly why they are doing it.<p>

There is a game bug that causes fireproof blankets to be positively affected by the Cursed and Doomed intrinsics. It makes them last almost forever in the ToEF.
It is probably not worth the Cursing or Dooming to make the blanket last. The ToEF is usually difficult enough in a Blessed state. <big>The bug is fixed in R+.</big><p>

The following items grant Cursing/Dooming intrinsics:<p>
<ul>
<li>Cursing only: Black Torc, Executor, <span class="newi">Bergbringer</span>
<li>Dooming only: armor/weapon/missile of damnation, javelin of doom, Celestrix
<li>both: ring of doom, Crown of Science, Crown of Chaos, Medal of Chaos, Sceptre of Chaos, Boots of Great Speed
</ul><p>

<h4 id="0c14">0.12.1.4 Lucky and Fate smiles</h4>
Basically, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics increases Luck, which is a hidden property. See section <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#064">0.6.4</a> for details.<p>

The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are the good counterparts to the Cursing and Dooming intrinsics, respectively. They cause the game to
nudge die-rolls in the PC's favor. The effect is not as dramatic as the Dooming and Cursing intrinsics &ndash; Fate smiles almost counters Cursing.
It should be noted that all four intrinsics may be present simultaneously. The negative ones are considerably stronger.<p>

The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are naturally gained by PCs as they sacrifice on coaligned altars; the messages are:<p>

"You feel an inner strength lifting your spirits!" &ndash; The Lucky intrinsic<br>
"You feel very close to -deity-." &ndash; The Fate smiles intrinsic<p>

Eating karmic corpses increases Luck, by losing Dooming, Cursing, or gaining Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics. Scrolls of luck work similarly but have no
effect on Dooming.<p>

The following items grant Lucky/Fate smiles intrinsics:<p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky only: amulet/ring of luck, Preserver, Bracers of War, Purifier, <span class="newi">Wyrm's Behest, Scorpion's Sting, Horn of Plenty</span>
<li>Fate smiles only: Ring of the Master Cat
<li>both: Ankh, True Strength, <span class="newi">Heart of Ancardia, Chainmail of the Martyred Crusader, Staff of Wonder, Silence of the Dead, Cornucopia</span>
</ul><p>

<h4 id="0c15">0.12.1.5 Teleportitis and Teleport control</h4>
Teleportitis is a "disease" that causes your PC to teleport around randomly. It is obtainable from pools (you feel jumpy), corruption (your close
attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation), from eating the right corpse (pixie) and items (helm of teleportation, Cloak of Oman, Manacles of Madness,
Boots of the Far Wanderer, Hornet's Sting). It can be useful for escaping tight spots such as being surrounded by monsters (though it never seems to kick in when needed ;),
for shoplifting and for reaching areas that are usually inaccessible. As of R65, teleportitis is not triggered while reading a spellbook. The prime danger of
uncontrolled teleportitis, however, is shopping &ndash; there is always a chance the character will teleport while carrying an unpaid item, resulting in the shopkeeper declaring
a robbery and trying to kill the involuntary shoplifter.<p>

To avoid this and make teleportitis an overall pleasant thing to have, it is crucial to obtain teleport control. Teleport control allows you to choose the destination when
teleporting your PC. It works whether the cause of the teleportation is teleportitis or deliberate, such as <tt>z</tt>apping a wand of teleportation or casting the Teleport
spell at the PC's current location. Mindcrafters always get Teleport control at experience level one, others have to rely on eating the right corpse (blink dog), drinking from
pools (you feel like jumping around) or wearing items (amulet/ring of teleport control, Boots of the Divine Messenger, Moloch's Thorns, Ring of the Archmages, Boots of the Far
Wanderer, Hornet's Sting).<p>

Controlled teleportation is important in the game. There is a guaranteed wand of teleportation in the VDDL level of the Assassin's Guild. It can be found using
any of the item detection techniques. The wand and potions of booze are then on-demand teleportation. Teleport control is not guaranteed but if necessary,
the PC can stair hop in the Infinite Dungeon between I3 and I4 until blink dogs are generated.<p>

The following locations disallow teleportation of any source:<p>
<ul>
<li>Any elemental temple. This does not include the lower levels of the Tower of Eternal Flames.
<li>Last level of the Tomb of the High Kings &ndash; the actual tomb containing the piranha lake and RotHK. (<a href="adomgb-2-12.html">2.12</a>)
<li>BUGCV &ndash; the underground level of the Bug Temple. (<a href="adomgb-2-3.html">2.3</a>)
<li>Cat Lord level. (<a href="adomgb-3-16.html">3.16</a>)
<li>Final level of the Assassins Guild. (<a href="adomgb-2-11.html#2b3">2.11.3</a>)
<li>D: 49. (<a href="adomgb-3-23.html">3.23</a>)
<li><big>Ice Queen Domain except Dungeon. (<a href="adomgb-2-22.html">2.22</a>)</big>
<li><span class="newi">Rolf's Fortress except Dungeon. (<a href="adomgb-2-27.html">2.27</a>)</span>
<li><span class="newi">Heavenly Area. (<a href="adomgb-3-17.html#3h4">3.17.4</a>)</span>
</ul><p>

In addition, Darkforge and Merchant Guild disallow teleportation until the area's boss (Kherab and Schwarzzahn, respectively) is dead.<p>

<h4 id="0c16">0.12.1.6 Invisibility and See invisible</h4>
Invisibility provides several bonuses to Stealth, Backstabbing, to hit/damage etc. Hostile monsters who don't see invisible will still occasionally hit the PC if they are next
to her, although they will not use any special attacks unless they actually see the PC. Be aware however that invisible PCs are not allowed to fight in the Arena.<p>

Invisibility can be gained by drinking from pools (you suddenly are gone), eating invisible stalker corpse (10% chance), or wearing items, such as ring/robe/cloak
of invisibility, Brannalbin's Cloak of Defence, or Tattered Cloak of the Dark Souls. Being invisible by wearing items severely increases food consumption, section
<a href="adomgb-0-3.html#032">0.3.2</a>. Potions of invisibility/visibility and the Invisibility spell provide temporary effect. Note that permanent invisibility may
be removed only by drinking from pools. You can also wear normal mummy wrappings.<p>

The See invisible intrinsic can be gained by drinking from pools (your eyes tingle), eating invisible stalker corpse (90% chance), wearing a ring of see invisible, Amulet of Raw
Steel, Medal of Chaos, Ring of the Master Cat, Crown of Leadership, Ancient Mummy Wrapping, Shirt of the Saints, Celestrix, Crowned Spiked Helmet of Chaos Lordship, Third Eye,
Robe of the Master Monk, Ring of the Archmages, Bracers of Pure Mind, Manacles of Madness, or wielding Rune-Covered Trident, Trident of The Red Rooster, Axe of the Minotaur
Emperor, Silence of the Dead, Masher, Scorpion's Sting, Judge &amp; Jury.<p>

<h4 id="0c17">0.12.1.7 Water breathing</h4>
Water breathing allows the PC to completely avoid drowning damage, be it while swimming over an open body of water, swimming in completely submerged locations,
or swimming in magma. It also reduces to about 1/3 the amount of damage the PC takes from water breath attacks.<p>

It is possible to gain the Water breathing intrinsic by eating Blup's or Shyssiryxius' corpse. The message "For some seconds a strange liquid seems to fill your lungs." is generated.<p>

Certain items and wielded weapons grant the intrinsic:<p>
<ul>
<li>helm/amulet of water breathing
<li>Rune-Covered Trident, Trident of the Red Rooster &ndash; when wielded
<li>Medal of Chaos, <big>Crowned Spiked Helmet of Chaos Lordship</big> &ndash; when worn
<li><span class="newi">Chainmail of the Martyred Crusader, Robe of the Master Monk, Boots of the Far Wanderer &ndash; when worn</span>
<li><span class="newi">Silence of the Dead, Harvester &ndash; when wielded</span>
</ul><p>

Elementalists receive Water breathing as an intrinsic class power at experience level 25. A non-artifact source of water breathing intrinsic (amulet or helm) is guaranteed
to be found at the bottom level of the Rift dungeon.<p>

The following items also stop drowning, although Water breathing is not listed as an intrinsic at the time.<p>
<ul>
<li>rings of the fish &ndash; autocursing; 1 blessed or 2 of any status stop drowning damage, single uncursed ring stops drowning 80%, cursed 60% of the time &ndash;
if the PC is not Cursed or Doomed
<li>armor of the sea &ndash; stops drowning 100%, 80%, 60% of the time B/U/C
</ul><p>

Water breathing is one of the three intrinsics in the game that cannot be received from sipping pools, the others being confusion and sickness resistance.<p>

<h4 id="0c2">0.12.2 Status conditions</h4>
Status conditions are effects caused by certain actions in the game that temporarily influence characteristics of the PC (or a monster, if
cast on one by certain means). Such characteristics include loss of HP, loss of certain attributes, inability to use certain commands or
even complete loss of mobility for a certain amount of turns. Some may even be fatal. Status conditions are almost always negative; though
a few can actually have positive effects.<p>

<h4 id="0c3">0.12.3 Item powers</h4>
For the effects of "Essence of Chaos and Corruption" power, section <a href="adomgb-0-10.html#0a24">0.10.2.4</a>.<p>

<h4 id="0c31">0.12.3.1 Regeneration</h4>
Regeneration is a special item power which generates one additional hit point per turn. It works in addition to natural regeneration described in section
<a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e6">0.14.6</a>. The effects are cumulative, so if the PC has two sourcers of Regeneration, she gains additional 2 HP per turn.
The following items grant Regeneration: crown/ring/bracers/staff of regeneration, knife of endurance, Bracers of War, Preserver, True Strength, Celestrix,
<span class="newi">Amulet of Indomitable Life, Chainmail of Raw Steel.</span> It is possible to regenerate a maximum of 9 <big>8</big> HP per turn via
Regeneration (head, amulet, girdle, hands, rings, bracers, missile). <big>Missile slot no longer provides regeneration.</big><p>

<h4 id="0c32">0.12.3.2 Critical hits</h4>
Critical hits is a special item power which allows the PC to score critical hits more often. If a Critical hit is scored, the attack message generated includes
"with full force" phrase. In case of missile attack, the message includes "exactly hit" phrase. As critical hits do not bypass PV, it is possible to receive the "You hit the
-monster- with full force and fail to hurt it." message. In such a case even the double amount of damage wasn't enough to get past the PV. Consider switching the form of offense.
The following items grant Critical hits: bloody dagger, whip of slaughtering, murderous weapon, Bracers of War, Ring of the Master Cat, Grod, Serpent's Bite, Axe of the Minotaur
Emperor, Spear of Raw Steel, <big>Foeslammer, Rapier of the Needle,</big> <span class="newi">Eagle's Claw, Harvester, Bloody Rose, Headman's Hand, Lead Great Axe.</span>
Refer to section <a href="adomgb-0-7.html#077">0.7.7</a> for more quantitative details.<p>

<h4 id="0c33">0.12.3.3 Autocursing</h4>
Autocursing items become cursed when equipped, generating message "the &lt;item&gt; suddenly glows in a black light!". It is obviously a bad effect, though not terrible for
moderately advanced PC, since the curse can be removed via regular means, which include dipping the item into potion of holy water, reading a scroll of uncursing, casting the
Remove Curse spell, praying, or using Wizard's 40th level class power (see also <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0ed">0.14.13</a>). The following mostly bad items share the
autocursing property: amulet of hunger, ring of doom, ring of the fish, ring of weakness, gauntlets of peace, boots of the slow shuffle, auto-locking armor, Black Torc,
Medal of Chaos, Crown of Science, Shezestriakis, Moon Sickle, Kinslayer, <span class="newi">Tattered Cloak of the Dark Souls.</span><p>

<h4 id="0c34">0.12.3.4 Slaying</h4>
Many artifact and few special regular weapons are imbued with Slaying powers. This means the particular weapon always scores a critical hit against certain monster types.
Vanquisher is very valued artifact weapon since it slays almost everything. A missile of slaying (without specification) slays everything. Refer to section
<a href="adomgb-0-9.html#094">0.9.4</a> to determine monster types. <span class="newi">Black Whip of Extinction slays everything and animals (not listed below).</span><p>

<table id="0c341" border=1><caption>Slaying weapons</caption>

</table><p>

<h4 id="0c35">0.12.3.5 Returning</h4>
Some missiles or weapons possess a special Returning power, which means the missile or weapon returns when thrown. This does not mean the PC
catches it automatically &ndash; the actual chance of successfully catching a returning missile depends on Dexterity and Luck. All artifact missiles
possess this power, and also the following weapons: boomerang, dagger/spear/drakish scurgar of returning, curved throwing club, javelin of doom,
Black Torc, Rolf's Companion, Rune-covered Trident, Trident of the Red Rooster, Hammer of the Gods, Spear of Raw Steel,
<span class="newi">Silence of the Dead, Gleaming Dwarven Rune Axe.</span><p>

<h4 id="0c36">0.12.3.6 Penetration</h4>
Penetration is the act of bypassing the PV of a creature in combat, dealing damage as if the creature has PV of 0. For PC, penetration can only
be achieved via a phase dagger, a penetrating weapon, a missile of penetration, or via Archer's 40th level class power, which grants 20% chance
of bypassing enemy armor when using missile. On the other hand, several monsters, such as ratling duelists and claw bugs, will always bypass
the PV of the PC. <big>Duelists fighting unencumbered can sometimes "locate a weak spot in the armor" of humanoid opponents. Their chance to do so
increases at level 25.</big><p>

<div class="resb">
<h4 id="0c37">0.12.3.7 Terror</h4>
Equipped items with this power periodically cause monsters to flee in panic. The effect is identical to the unholy aura corruption. Take great care when near shopkeepers!
Crowning gifts for Chaos Knights mostly feature this power. Terror items include the following artifacts: Spiked Armor of Chaos and Terror, Crowned Spiked Helmet of Chaos
Lordship, Foeslammer, <span class="newi">Michals Transmogrifier.</span><p>
</div>

<div class="newb">
<h4 id="0c38">0.12.3.8 PP regeneration</h4>
Few items have the ability to enhance PP regeneration by +1, similarly to HP regeneration discussed earlier in 0.12.3.1. Items with this power: empowered armor,
bracers of empowerment, Circlet of the Pure Mind, Manacles of Madness, Staff of Wonder, Chainmail of the Martyred Crusader, Kalmius' Shield, Ring of the Archmages.<p>

<h4 id="0c39">0.12.3.9 Purity</h4>
Purity items prevent or reduce background corruption. Special corrupting areas (ChAoS Plane, Scintillating Cave 9) will still corrupt the PC. Mundane item with this
power are bracers/robe of purity. Artifacts: Aylas Holy Scarf, Bracers of Pure Might, Chainmail of the Martyred Crusader.<p>

Refer to chapter <a href="adomgb-0-10.html#0a21">0.10.2.1</a> for discussion of background corruption. Cursed purity items provide 1 protection level, uncursed 2, and blessed 3.
This is added together if multiple purity items are equipped. 5 or higher protection level seems to eliminate background corruption completely, except for Emperor Moloch Lair
and Chaos Plane.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Purity protection</caption>

</table><p>

<h4 id="0c3a">0.12.3.10 Blood sucking</h4>
Certain artifact weapons can drink blood from living monsters, enhancing one or more of the following stats: to-hit (precision), damage (lethality),
DV (parry attacks), PV (block attacks), Speed (move faster), Strength, Dexterity, Toughness. The bonuses gradually increase as the weapon damages living monsters, but
drop back to base values over time. Constructs, insects, jellies, plants, undead, (dwarven) chaos knights, and (greater/emperor) molochs apparently do not have blood,
and thus will not power up these weapons. Blood sucking weapons include: Fang, Masher, Whip of the Vampire Snake, Arak's Guard, Judge &amp; Jury, Silence of the Dead,
Headman's Hand, and Hornet's Sting.<p>
</div>

<h4 id="0c4">0.12.4 Item statuses</h4>
The following statuses modify the item's function or stats in some way. More than one status can be present at the same time.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rusty</b> &ndash; iron items become rusty by exposure to water &ndash; swimming, water traps, rain, water breath attacks. Water traps and rain can be prevented by
wearing cloak. Other common cause to rusting is (large/giant) rust monster. Dipping iron items into a potion of water or cursed oil of rust removal also results in rusty status.
Rusty weapons deal half damage and are more prone to breaking. Rusty armor reduces Appearance by 1 and is more prone to destruction. Rusty tools are more liable to breaking when
used (rusty climbing set can lead to death). Rusty wands usually function normally, except (ball) lightning. Rust is removed by dipping the item into a non-cursed oil of rust removal,
or via Smithing/Glod.
<li><b>Broken</b> &ndash; weapons, keys and wands may become broken simply by frequent usage. Blessed items are less prone to breaking, cursed more. Cursed scrolls of repair break
items, even the non-breakable ones (such as herbs; broken potions still can be quaffed with usual effect, broken scrolls and books can be read etc. <big>fixed</big>). Broken weapons
deal only half damage (cumulative with rust). Broken wands and keys are non-functional. Broken status of metal items (except gold <span class="newi">and truesilver</span>, since there
are no gold ingots) can be removed by Smithing. Non-cursed scroll of repair or Glod will remove broken status from any item or items stack.
<li><b>Rustproof</b> &ndash; invulnerable to water and rust. Rustproof items are created by dipping metal items into a potion of oil (may fail, cursed <big>blessed</big> works best)
or a blessed oil of rust removal. It makes sense only for iron items, since other metals (mithril, adamantium, eternium, gold, and truesilver) aren't damaged by water. Few iron items
are naturally rustproof &ndash; lead sling bullet, drakish scurgar, ring of the fish, amulet/helm of water breathing, and iron ore.
<li><b>Waterproof</b> &ndash; functionally identical to rustproof, but for non-metal items (waterproof waterproof blanket possible). Note that rust monsters ignore all non-iron items.
Waterproof items are created by dipping non-metal items into a potion of oil (may fail, cursed <big>blessed</big> works best) or a blessed oil of rust removal. It makes sense only for
scrolls and books, since other materials aren't damaged by water. No items are naturally waterproof.
<li><b>Poisoned</b> &ndash; weapons, missiles and food items can be made poisoned by diping them into a potion of poison (any status). Weapons and missiles are denoted by (p) after
the stats, instead of saying "poisoned", like for food items. Poisoned status wears off after few hits from poisoned weapons. Poisoned food can also be used as a missile to poison
monsters. The status always dissappears from missiles and food after they are fired, regardless of whether they hit or not.
<li><b>Cooked</b> &ndash; corpses improved by the Cooking skill, or Fire Bolt, Fireball, Improved Fireball spells, wand of fire(balls), failed Alchemny, or used crystal of fire.
Also monster's fire breath can create cooked corpses. Their nutrition value is doubled, weight decreased by 5%, and rotting is 4x slower.
<li><b>Lit</b> &ndash; torches. You need to have both tinderbox and box with flint and steel with charges left to make a torch lit, unless a lit torch is already available. A lit torch
negates darkness, in the tool slot increases visibility radius by 3 tiles, and disables Stealth. In addition to the natural melee damage rating of 1d4, a lit torch will deal 1d4
fire damage. A lit torch can't be in the backpack, however you can lit 3 torches at the same time &ndash; in both hands and in the tool slot.
</ul><p>

Artifacts are mostly excluded from these statuses, except they can be poisoned by dipping them into a potion of poison and broken with a cursed scroll of repair.
<big>Fixed in R+.</big><p>
