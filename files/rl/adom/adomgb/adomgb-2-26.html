<h3>Merchant Guild</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-26-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Merchant Guild is a one level area found by searching on the hills by the High Mountain Village while possessing the Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics.<p>

It contains great treasures, including four random artifacts and massive number of gold pieces depending on at what level the PC first visits (hundreds of
thousands at low levels, millions at high levels). It is possible to access the gold rooms by digging. The bottom-left corner of the rightmost room is digable,
and the top-left corner of the central room is digable. The tile behind the Great Gray Wyrm is digable, and a corridor of digable tiles connects the
top-left corner of the room behind him to the top-left corner of the leftmost room. Unfortunately, the artifacts are surrounded by indestructible walls,
and teleportation is prevented on the level until the Great Gray Wyrm dies. Reportedly, not even a wand of destruction would break the walls surrounding the artifacts, 
so killing the wyrm and controlled teleportation might be the only way to get them.<p>

All monsters in the guild are initially non-hostile. The guild is staffed by numerous gray scribes and is guarded by eternium golems. Attacking the guild will cause more eternium golems
to begin spawning at the entrance. More are summoned every few turns if killed, as long as the Great Gray Wyrm is still alive. Chatting with the Great Gray Wyrm while owing money to the
Merchant Guild will cause eternium golems to block the entrance until the debt is paid.<p>

All the gray scribes are uniquely named. They don't like to be disturbed, working on various tasks for the guild. In combat they are rather weak, but are able to cast Energy ray
and are immune to confusion. Eternium golems have enormous PV, are powerful in melee combat, and can breathe acid. They are immune to fire and shock attacks.<p>

<h4 id="2q2">2.26.2 Naar'Dwar, the gray master scribe <tt>@</tt></h4>

As the other gray scribes, Naar'dwar casts energy ray and cannot be confused. Otherwise he is somewhat stronger than the regural scribes in melee.<p>

<h4 id="2q3">2.26.3 Schwarzzahn, the great gray wyrm <tt>W</tt></h4>

Schwarzzahn is immune to all elements, breathes fire, casts glowing balls, confuses, and rapidly regenerates. If the wyrm is blinded, every few turns its eyes will glow,
causing more eternium golems to appear at the entrance of the guild. Killing it is rather difficult task, requiring tons of dragon slaying ammo.<p>
