<h3>Water Temple</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-9-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>
The Water Temple, found on either D: 19 or D: 20, is  the first elemental temple that most PCs will encounter. Note that the temple itself is
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. There are four traps <tt>^</tt> surrounding
the chaotic elemental altar <tt>_</tt> where the orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are
very dangerous. The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should she step on it. In addition, they can
only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an Ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving
the Medal of Chaos.<p>

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in, then attack the monsters. It is not necessary to cross the water although it is more convenient if this is possible. If the water
cannot be crossed the Snake from Beyond can be zapped with a bolt from a wand or spell and will eventually emerge. However, it may flee back across the water. Lure it to the previous
level before attacking. All the monsters are vulnerable to fire based attacks. The grues and demons in particular are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee
attack that has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually &ndash; a good reason to develop the PCs missile weapon skills. The snakes,
including the Snake from Beyond, are poisonous. Invisibility is useful but not a panacea. The Snake from Beyond and the chaos servants see invisible. None of the monsters sees in darkness.<p>

The Snake from Beyond is a formidable opponent. It generally does not kill a PC that has made it this far, but has nasty poisonous and corrupting attacks that rarely miss. It can swim,
and is immune to poison, but can be stunned with a potion of cure poison. If possible, it should be killed from a distance, easier said than done in the close quarters of the Water Temple.
It is vulnerable to demon slayers.<p>

<h4 id="393">3.9.3 Chaos Orb of Elemental Water <tt>]</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item302.png" alt="cooew" align="left">
The Snake from Beyond holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water. While worn in the tool slot, it raises Willpower by 10. When <tt>U</tt>sed, it restores all the HP, though doing so adds 600 corruption
points (300 with Elemental Gauntlets equipped). Note that while it can also be used as a melee or missile weapon, wielding it as such won't confer the Willpower bonus.<p style="clear:none">

The healing ability is one of the few ways to restore all your HP in one action, and the only one that's both indestructible and inexhaustible. Blessed potions of ultra healing can be shattered by
item destruction, and prayers rely on stockpiled piety to work. The corruptive effect is enough to make sure you won't use it outside of emergencies, but negligible in the face of death in combat.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
-------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} ---------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +10.

(full heal + corruption when <tt>U</tt>sed)
