<h3>Blue Dragon Caves</h3>
Blue Dragon Caves is the name commonly given to a five level dungeon found deep in the Caverns of Chaos. It is entered from a staircase found on the fourth
level of the Unreal Caves (the one that Sharad-Waador is found standing beside); making it a side-branch of a side-branch of the caverns. It is referred to as
"some ancient dragon caves" in the death log, and uses the shorthand "DL" ingame.<p>

All five levels of the Blue Dragon Caves are cavernous, meaning they have a high monster generation rate and a lot of open space. Unsurprisingly, there are a
lot of blue dragons found in the caves. Blue baby dragons appear on the first level, whilst blue dragons and ancient blue dragons appear on deeper levels. In addition
to the many varied blue dragons found in these caves, other nasty high level monsters may be found here, including chaos wizards, greater titans and greater molochs,
for example. It is wise to have some means of dealing with greater molochs along, whether it is simply speed for running away, phase daggers or demon slayers. High speed is
virtually essential for killing Srraxxarrakex, as well.<p>

Upon entering the fifth and final level of the caves, the following message is generated: "These ancient caves are covered with marks
from huge reptiles... hundreds of such marks." The final level contains only blue dragons and great blue wyrms. Srraxxarrakex will be found on this level.<p>

Whilst the levels can yield huge amounts of treasure (scrolls of corruption removal, wands of wishing, rings of djinni summoning etc.) due to the abundance of dragons and wyrms,
PCs are also very vulnerable to item destruction due to being constantly subjected to lightning breath. Most players will just take on the caves to satisfy Sharad-Waador's quest,
if attempting an Ultra ending.<p>

Sraxxarrakex is a very powerful ancient blue wyrm, more powerful than any other ancient wyrm in the game. He is, as might be expected, immune to shock. One of the things that makes him so
difficult to defeat is the fact that he naturally regenerates <i>and</i> casts powerful healing spells at the same time. He has three attacks per round, so he can, for instance, breathe a
lightning bolt, attack in melee, cast heal, while still getting natural regeneration <i>per round</i>. He can also confuse the PC from a distance, and also casts glowing balls.
The PC must be capable of dealing massive amounts of damage quickly in order to defeat him. He can be attacked in almost any way, including melee, missiles and magic. He is of course vulnerable
to dragon slaying missiles and melee weapons.<p>
