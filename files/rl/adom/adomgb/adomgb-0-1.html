<h3 id="01">Character creation</h3>
Character creation is done at the beginning of the game. During this process, you choose star sign (random in free version), gender, race, class (profession), attributes (points or questions)
(only questions in free version), starting talents, and name. Your character's age, history, and any special birth messages are chosen for you.<p>

Hair, eyes, complexion, weight, and height are generated randomly and have no effect in-game. The minor exception is weight, which is taken into account when entering the Quickling Tree
and calculating the chance of ice beneath the PC breaking.<p>

<ol type="A">
<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Raven:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/raven.png" alt="Raven" align="left" width=64>
+10 Speed, +2 Pe, messengers, harder to trick, stronger companions</b><br>
The +10 to Speed is good for all PCs. It can save the life of low level PCs who need to run away from a monster they can't handle. The "messengers
will reach you faster" refers to the delivery of the Rune-covered Trident, which happens faster for those born in this month, at level 16 rather than 36, a nice bonus. The "harder
to trick by deceptions" grants 75% chance to evade a doppelganger's confusion attack. The stronger companions characteristic makes this month excellent for <b>Bards</b>.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Book:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/book.png" alt="Book" align="left" width=64>
+3 Le, lawful tendencies, one free skill increase every level, better at learning spells</b><br>
Lawful tendencies means +500 to initial alignment and decrease of all alignment changes towards chaotic by 10%.
One free skill increase each level helps all PCs, especially those with low Learning. Increased chance to learn spells
means borderline casters have a better chance, experiencing less negative effects while learning spells. This is not the ideal month for
a Wizard &ndash; they are already great at learning spells. More suited to <b>elven fighting classes</b> or a <b>Dwarvish Paladin</b>.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Wand:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/wand.png" alt="Wand" align="left" width=64>
+2 Ch, lawful tendencies, if neutral: +2 Ma, +10 PP, 10% cheaper spells</b><br>
Lawful tendencies means +500 to initial alignment and decrease of all alignment changes towards chaotic by 10%.
Here we have the sign for a <b>neutral Wizard</b>. Gray Elven Wizards are ideal with their naturally high Mana and neutral alignment.
They are somewhat difficult to keep alive in the early game but become enormously powerful in the mid- and endgame. Note that both Wand-born
Healers of chaotic races and Necromancers of lawful races start out neutral.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Unicorn:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/unicorn.png" alt="Unicorn" align="left" width=64>
+2 Ap, harder to corrupt, harder to change from lawful</b><br>
Generic sign with resistance to corruption. Pretty attractive for any PC going for an Ultra ending, especially an aspiring <b>Avatar of Order</b>. The fact
that lawful alignment is difficult to change means such a PC can commit a few chaotic acts and get away with it without becoming a fallen champion.
The Unicorn birthsign reduces corruption by 19% if the PC is L, by 37% if L+, and increases it by 30% for C-. All negative alignment changes for lawful PCs
are reduced by 20%.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Salamander:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/salamander.png" alt="Salamander" align="left" width=64>
+1 Ch, +3 Ma, +20% PP, fire magic 20% cheaper</b><br>
Very attractive for <b>Elementalists</b>, who rely on a lot of fire magic. Not half bad for a <b>Necromancer</b> who finds some fire-based spellbooks, either.
Necromancers need that +3 to Mana. Fire magic includes: Burning Hands, Fire Bolt, Fireball, and Improved Fireball.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Dragon:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/dragon.png" alt="Dragon" align="left" width=64>
+2 St, +1 To, -3 Wi, 10% increased effects from Tactics setting, 10% less marks for weapon skills, combat magic 10% cheaper</b><br>
<b>Fighters</b>. The +1 to Toughness is not significant &ndash; that is within the variability for the attribute for identical race/class PCs. The -3 to Willpower
is significant and makes this unattractive for those who need it in the early game &ndash; Wizards, Mindcrafters. Not a bad month for <b>Paladins</b> with both
weapon and combat magic costs reduced. Combat magic includes: Destroy Undead, Magic Missile, Burning Hands, Fire Bolt, Frost Bolt, Acid Bolt, Fireball, Improved Fireball, 
Death Ray.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Sword:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/sword.png" alt="Sword" align="left" width=64>
+1 Le, 10% increased positive effects from Tactics setting, 20% less marks for weapon skills</b><br>
Learning bonus is insignificant, although it can push a PC from illiterate to literate. The 20% reduction in cost to train melee weapon skills makes this
attractive for a PC that really wants to become super-proficient with a weapon. Not a bad choice for <b>Rangers</b>, who start the game dual wielding swords.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Falcon:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/falcon.png" alt="Falcon" align="left" width=64>
+2 Wi, +1 Ch, Survival skill, one free talent</b><br>
Grants the Survival skill to any character. This skill is generally considered as being of little use (section <a href="adomgb-0-4.html">0.4</a>).
The Willpower bonus is somewhat useful for spellcasters and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, although better starsigns exist for those classes.
The Charisma bonus is of little significance for any character. The free talent is good for all PCs, especially for <b>Gnomish and Hurthling Bards</b>,
as it guarantees them both a very useful Heir gift and the possibility to go for the Treasure Hunter talent.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Cup:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/cup.png" alt="Cup" align="left" width=64>
+2 Le, 10% less experience points to advance,  one free skill advance every two levels, learns spells 20% more effectively</b><br>
Another sign for <b>Wizards</b>. Higher Learning to start and the 10% reduction to gain a level means they advance rapidly, which is very helpful in keeping them
alive at low level. The 20% effectivity increase in learning spells also helps keep them alive in the early game, while the player has not had time to raise
their Learning attribute. While this bonus does not affect the chance to successfully learn a spell, it directly influences spell knowledge gained.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Candle:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/candle.png" alt="Candle" align="left" width=64>
heals faster, one free talent, 16% reduced prayer costs</b><br>
This can be an unbelievable sign for <b>Trolls</b>. They heal rapidly anyway, but those born in this month almost don't need the Healing skill! Almost. Get it and they
seem to have natural regeneration. Playing a <b>trollish Healer</b> born in this month is almost cheating. ;-) Candle-born characters are guaranteed to heal 2 hitpoints
every 12 turns. <big>Candle has been slightly nerfed in R+, providing 2 hitpoints every 20 turns, making it about 80% as effective as Healing at 100, instead of 133% as effective.</big>

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Wolf:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/wolf.png" alt="Wolf" align="left" width=64>
+3 Wi, +3 Pe, food 10% <big>25%</big> more nutritious</b><br>
Significant benefits to Perception and Willpower. The Willpower is good for <b>Wizards</b> and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, of course.
<b>Drakeling</b> characters, relying on their acid spit ability, can benefit from nutrition bonus, while <b>Troll</b>
adventurers will experience less difficulty in managing their increased food requirements.

<li style="clear:left; padding-top:12px"><b>Tree:<img style="background:black" src="tiles/tree.png" alt="Tree" align="left" width=64>
+5 Wi, <big>+2 To, +1 PV</big>, harder to change alignment</b><br>
Made for <b>Mindcrafters</b>, who really need that +5 to Willpower in the early game. Not bad for <b>Wizards</b> either. The Tree birthsign reduces all alignment changes by 10%.
</ol><p>

<p style="clear:left; padding-top:12px">The Candle starsign is by far the best for any character, with Raven being the distant second.
The Candle healing effect is great for everyone and it is better than the Healing skill at 100. Raven's speed bonus allows all characters to outrun most opponents.
The effects of other starsigns are utterly negligible when compared to Raven and especially Candle.</p>

<h4 id="0122">0.1.2.2 Special birth messages</h4>
If you are really lucky (5% chance), one of these messages will be generated along with the star sign:<p>
The night you were born....<br>
<ul>
<li>...the local undead were seen packing up and moving away.<br>
It means that your character will gain (or is born with?) the "natural
enemy of undead" intrinsic. This makes undead flee from you periodically.
This also means you always slay undead in melee &ndash; same effect as !Unde weapons.<p>

<li>...your long-lost brother showed up again.<br>
Greater chance of special locations generated in dungeons (hives, shops,
pools, etc).<p>

<li>...a two-headed calf was born the same night.<br>
10% fewer experience points are required for an experience level increase.<p>

<li>...a falling star killed the village elder.<br>
10% fewer experience points are required for an experience level increase.<p>
</ul><p>

<h4 id="013">0.1.3 Gender</h4>
The gender of the character has little significance. The following table lists all known gameplay differences.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Gender differences</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>Male &#9794;<th>Female &#9792;<th>More info

<h4 id="014">0.1.4 Race and class</h4>
A list of the races and classes (called professions) can be found in the <a href="adomman-D.html">ADOM Manual</a>. It also gives a bit of background about each,
much of which is flavor and irrelevant in terms of gameplay.<p>

<h4 id="0141">0.1.4.1 Specific starting trained skills and alignment</h4>
Each race has unique characteristics including initial alignment, trained skills and modifiers to attributes. Skills in ADOM vary in terms of availability. All PCs are born with
Climbing [1dDx + 1z10 + 20], First Aid [1dLe + 1z10 + 15], Haggling [1dCh + 1z10 + 15], and Listening [1dPe + 1z10 + 20]. All PCs other than Beastfighters and Barbarians with
Learning attribute of 10 or greater are born with Literacy [Le*4]. Many skills can be taught or trained by various NPCs during the game. Other skills are much more difficult
to obtain if the PC is not born with them. Skills other than Alertness and Healing can be wished for. Any skill can be obtained from a potion of education, but this is a matter
of random chance and cannot be counted on. Skills available only from wishes or potions of education are referred to as "Nonguaranteed skills" for the sake of the tables below.
The first table shows the starting alignment and trained skills [starting value] that each race is born with (z is a dice with a zero: 1z10 means a number between 0 and 9, ie.
1z5+5 means a value between 5 and 9).<p>

Lawful alignment is +2000, neutral is 0, and chaotic -2000. This is then modified by class and starsign: Druids have alignment
set to 0, Necromancers get -1500 and Healers get +1000. Lawful tendencies starsigns (Wand and Book) get +500. <big>Chaos Knights start with alignment set to -10000.</big><p>

[1] Bards never get: Necromancy, Bridge Building, Tactics, Law, Courage. Every other skill (except Music) has 25% chance, with starting value of [1d20 + 15].<p>
[2] If specializing in potions, then Alchemy [1dLe], else if specializing in scrolls then Literacy [1d20 + 30] else (wands or rings) Survival [1d20 + 20].<p>

Falcon birthsign increases Survival by 10, or grants Survival at 10 if there was no Survival by race or class.<p>

<span id="01413"></span>
The manual also states that Bards get more skills than other classes. Testing does not agree with this. What the manual fails to mention is the two free skill advances per level Bards receive.
This is useful for races that have low initial Learning attributes, such as Orcs and Trolls.<p>

There are definite effects on gameplay depending on the alignment, skills and birthsign the PC is born with. Note that none of the races is born with the Healing skill; it is entirely
class-dependent. Nine classes are born with Healing. It is essential to obtain this skill (except for those born under Candle). This means that those without it <i>must</i> choose Rynt's
quest as opposed to Guth'Alak's in Terinyo, whether they intend to actually obtain the skill from Jharod or Kranf Niest. This puts restrictions on the game right away, since the Keethrax
quest and thus a guaranteed artifact and potion of cure corruption are forfeited before the game even starts. Further, three races start with chaotic alignment. If the PC wants to receive
Healing from Jharod, thus avoiding Kranf Niest's attribute drains, alignment must be changed to neutral (or lawful).<p>

Note also that no race starts with Herbalism, the other skill available through a Terinyo quest. If the player wants maximum flexibility &ndash; to do either Rynt's or Guth'Alak's quest,
or neither (in the case of a minimalist challenge game) &ndash; choose a class that starts with Healing, Herbalism, or ideally both, such as a Beastfighter, Druid, Healer, Priest,
Ranger or Wizard.<p>

If there is a skill that is difficult to obtain that you cannot live without, such as Alertness, play a Dark Elf or Drakeling, or choose a class that is born with it &ndash; Archers,
Healers, Monks, Rangers and Thieves all start with this skill. Many players feel similarly about Detect Item Status &ndash; play Priests or Merchant for a challenge.<p>

A PC that trains a given skill due to both race and class will be especially proficient with that skill. This makes certain combinations especially powerful. Dwarven Weaponsmiths
(doubly trained Metallurgy and Smithing), Hurthling Archers (doubly trained Archery), Hurthling Farmers (doubly trained Archery, Cooking, Food Preservation, Gardening, Stealth) and
Dark Elven Rangers (doubly trained Alertness and Climbing) are examples.<p>

[1] Can be <i>any</i> skill, and does not have the restrictions imposed on character creation. Bards gain 1d20 + 20 in those skills.<p>
[2] Stolen items must have at least 10 value.<p>
[3] Trains St by (Level*5)-155)*4, Dx by (Level*5)-155), and To by ((Level*3)-93)*10.<p>
[4] Shadow Touch will regain HP first; if maxed, it will regain PP instead. PP Gained is DamageDealt / 2, HP Gained is DamageDealt / 3. There is DamageDealt/1000 chance to get +1 Mana. If 1d10000-1 &lt; damage dealt, you gain 1 Mana.<p>
[5] Also receives only 1/3 of drowning damage.<p>
[6] Melting ability is determined by the weight of what you're melting down as far as how many ingots you'll get. This means for example ultra-heavy armors are especially nice for melting down. Blessed hammer + blessed metal = 9:1000 (9 ingots for 1000 stones); B+U = 8,1:1000; B+C = 6,3:1000; U+U = 7,2:1000; U+C = 5,6:1000; C+C = 4,4:1000. Failing a Smithing roll halves the amount you get.<p>
[7] If monster Level&lt;50 and monster not unique: (50-moblevel)*2 / 1000 chance for instant kill.<p>
[8] If monster not unique, and (monster is humanoid but not undead/construct), and (monster size &lt; 3 or Monk Level &gt;= 40): (50-moblevel)*2 / 1000 chance for instant kill.<p>
[9] Skeletons, zombies, ghuls, shadows, ghosts, wights, wraiths, ghost bats, slow shadows, mummies, corpse fiends, shadow centipedes, dwarven ghost warriors.<p>
[10] Liches, spectres, vampires, revenants, skeletal warriors, ghost lords, shadow trolls, master liches, shadow lords, greater mummies, steel zombies, vile spirits, frozen ones, dwarven battle spirits.<p>

<span id="01433"></span>Higher Xp number means more experience is required to advance a level.<p>

Now add +1 St for males, +1 Dx for females. Add further modifiers for starsign, history, age, opening questions, and talents. New characters usually have somewhat higher starting attributes
than the above tables suggest.<p>

<!--- Note on the Xp column. It represents how hard is a particular race/class to advance levels. Basically, multiply the two numbers to get a Xp ratio. For Cup borns (and some
starting messages), multiply again with 0.9. There are few exceptions to this rule however: Troll Farmers and Troll Merchants have Xp ratio of 3, and Orc Priests have 1.4.
Xp ratio of 1 means the PC will require about 150 xp to advance to lvl 2. It varies depending on starting attributes, lower attributes mean lower lvl 2 requirement, so weaker
PC's have somewhat easier time when advancing levels. Multiply 150 with Xp ratio to get approximated level 2 xp requirement. For higher levels, multiply the xp needed for previous
level by x, where x gradually decreases from 1.9 to 1.0666.<p>--->

<h4 id="0144">0.1.4.4 Race/class combinations</h4>
The ADOM Manual gives some hints about race/class combinations. For instance, the manual identifies Trolls as the strongest, toughest and stupidest race in the game and suggests that
they make good fighters (because of their Strength and Toughness) and lousy magicians (because of their low Learning and Mana). This is true as far as it goes, but Trollish Wizards
can be a viable combination if they are played more as fighters to start and later develop their magical talents. Elves make fantastic Wizards (due to their high Learning and
Mana) once they gain some experience, but are difficult to keep alive in the early game because of their low Toughness. Humans are a jack of all trades race and can be used with
all classes. Some combinations favored by newsgroup readers:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Trollish Beastfighters and Barbarians</b> &ndash; brute force fighters
<li><b>Gnomish Elementalists</b> &ndash; magic users with more Toughness than elves
<li><b>Elven Archers</b> &ndash; natural talent with bows
<li><b>Elven Wizards</b> &ndash; high Mana and Learning
<li><b>Dwarven Weaponsmiths</b> &ndash; natural Smithing talent
<li><b>Hurthling Archers</b> &ndash; natural talent with thrown rocks
<li><b>Orcish Priests</b> &ndash; access to spells, Detect Item Status and decent Toughness
</ul><p>

Classes and combinations that are regarded as difficult:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Farmers</b>
<li><b>Merchants</b>, especially Dark Elven Merchants because of their low Charisma and Toughness
<li><b>Necromancers</b> in general are very difficult to keep alive at low levels
</ul><p>

Press <tt>B</tt> to determine your age and age category. You can start the game as either young or adult. The age category has definite effects on your attributes,
listed in the effects fields. Generally, you lose Strength, Toughness, Appearance, and Perception with age. On the other hand, you gain Learning, Willpower, and Mana.
During normal game, you naturally age very slowly, and this should almost never become any problem. However, undead attacks may unnaturally change your age and age
category very quickly, depending on race. Use potions of youth to reverse the effects of unnatural aging. Potions of longevity increase your max age. Beware of cursed
potions of youth and longevity though &ndash; they may result in an immediate death of old age.<p>

<h4 id="0146">0.1.4.6 Special considerations</h4>
<b>Dark Elves</b> &ndash; Dark Elves receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop. Dark Elven Necromancers are very chaotic. It takes some work to
get them to Neutral alignment to receive Healing from Jharod, for instance, if that is desired. Dark Elves are unique in that spider corpses are nutritious for them. Poison
resistance can still be gained from spider corpses. Also, if a Dark Elven PC is caught in a web and covered by "hundreds of tiny spiders", they won't be bitten and thus won't
get poisoned (instead, the message "You welcome your spidery friends." is generated after the spiders swarm). Unlike most other races, Dark Elves' line of sight increases
in the nighttime and decreases during the daytime. In open areas Dark Elves get -8 Pe (-4 at dawn and dusk). They also have -4 melee to-hit and -8 ranged to-hit (-2 melee to-hit
and -4 ranged to-hit at dawn and dusk).<p>

<b>Drakelings</b> &ndash; Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF (section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html#252">2.5.2</a>) and D: 49 (section <a href="adomgb-3-23.html#3n1">3.23.1</a>).
Drakelings who are unlucky enough to find a greater white dragon vault will also face speed problems. Drakelings have a unique racial acid spit &ndash; press <tt>m</tt> to use it
&ndash; which does Max(2,Level/3)d6+(Level/2) damage, has Max(2, St/4) range, hits target if 1d(Level+10)+Dx &gt; MonstersDV+3, and consumes 5d10+50 food points per spit.<p>

<b>Dwarves</b> &ndash; Dwarves have unique access to the Mithril skin talent (+3 PV), and they find secret doors and traps quicker (+20 bonus to Detect Traps skill). Also, they 
are more likely to receive the Rolf's Savior artifact, and they can read runes on Griff Bloodax's grave.<p>

<b>Elves</b> &ndash; All elves, High, Gray, or Dark, have very long lifespans. This is worth considering since several of the high level monsters encountered in
ADOM have an aging attack. Ghost Lords, for instance, may well age a Human or Troll to death in one or two hits, since these PCs have a life span of 100 years or so
at most. Elven PCs do not need to worry about this, since they live for about 1000 years. Balancing this is the fact that they are more fragile than other races in
terms of Toughness in the early game.<p>

<b>Gnomes</b> &ndash; Gnomes require only 3/4 the number of missile weapon marks to advance their crossbow skill level relative to other races.<p>

<b>Humans</b> &ndash; Humans get two additional skill increases on level-up.<p>

<b>Hurthlings</b> &ndash; Hurthlings start the game with the Thrown Rocks missile weapon skill at level four. They also start the game wearing a cursed ring, unfortunately.
Hurthlings also have a racial dislike for shoes, which causes a loss of Dexterity when Hurthlings use footwear in ADOM. Hurthlings also have an advantage over other races when
training the slings and thrown rocks missile weapon skills: they require only two thirds of the marks other races do in order to advance a skill level.<p>

<b>Orcs</b> &ndash; Like Dark Elves, Orcs receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop. Orcs have a short lifespan relative to other races.
Unlike most other races, Orcs' line of sight increases in the nighttime and decreases during the daytime. <big>In open areas Orcs get -4 Pe and minor penalties to melee
and ranged to-hit (about -2 for melee and -4 for ranged).</big><p>

<b>Trolls</b> &ndash; Trolls need about double the amount of food compared to other races. They advance in experience level very slowly relative to other races.
Trolls start the game with the Twohanded Weapons melee skill at level two. Do not pay any attention to this if you are playing a trollish Beastfighter. Drop that
club and fight unarmed.<p>

<div class="resb">
<b>Mist Elves</b> &ndash; Mist Elves are most unique of all races. Their lifespan is infinite for all practical purposes, and their magical abilities are by far the best.
Additionaly, Mist Elves take only half damage from melee attacks, and lose 0.5 fewer satiation point per turn. Now for the disadvantages: they suffer from low Toughness and HP,
their HP gain is always halved, but their main weakness is their hate of iron &ndash; they take damage from wearing iron items. The amount of damage depends on the type of item:
one hit point for amulets, bracers or gloves; two hit points for boots, helmet or weapon; five for body armor. They can wear one iron ring without taking damage. Similarly
to Dark Elves, they get terrible prices in shops. Finally, lawful and neutral Mist Elves practice White Necromancy, instead of the usual Necromancy. This unique skill requires
lumps of clay to create constructs. Read more about this skill in section <a href="adomgb-0-11.html#0b8">0.11.8</a>.<p>

<b>Ratlings</b> &ndash; No known inherent racial abilities.<p>
</div>   

<b>Archers</b> &ndash; Archers find more ammunition and fletchery sets, and start at skill level 1 for their starting missile weapon.<p>

<b>Assassins</b> &ndash; First Alchemy recipe is always for potion of poison. Assassins can receive the Filk quest as soon as level 30. Assassins start with level 4
in Thrown Daggers, and level 4 or 5 in Daggers &amp; Knives. <big>They get increased damage from backstabbing with daggers.</big><p>

<b>Barbarians</b> and <b>Beastfighters</b> &ndash; With the exception of Elves, they start illiterate. They also face huge difficulties learning spells.<p>

<b>Bards</b> &ndash; Bards have an advantage when using Music; their chances for taming/calming down monsters is higher than other classes. Also, pets won't turn on a
Bard upon triggering traps on them. Moreover, Bards will find more variation in item modifiers: to-hit/damage in weapons/missiles and DV/PV in armor. Finally,
Bards receive two additional skill increases on level-up.<p>

<b>Druids</b> &ndash; All Druids start at neutral zero alignment, and get spellbook of Lightning Bolt. Non-summoned animals are neutral towards Druids (including cats).
Bugs in the Bug-Infested Temple are not included. Druids need 50% more marks to increase weapon skills. They get a different reward for completing the Druid quest.<p>

<b>Farmers</b> &ndash; Farmers start the game with a large dog pet, level two in Polearms weapon skill and require 20% less marks to increase their Polearms level.<p>

<b>Fighters</b> &ndash; The number of marks required to increase melee and missile weapon skills is reduced by 16%.<p>

<b>Healers</b> &ndash; The number of turns usually required for natural HP regeneration is halved for Healers. They do not spend any turns whilst using a stethoscope.<p>

<b>Merchants</b> &ndash; Merchants always specialize in a certain item category: potions, rings, scrolls, or wands. This specialization allows them to identify any item in that
category on sight. Merchants have the ability to use thrown gold pieces as effective missiles. Doppelgangers are not able to deflect gold pieces thrown by Merchants.
This is the only known way to attack doppelgangers with missiles. Merchants also receive better shop prices, the exception is Terinyo shop. They also find more shops, 
and when any shop restocks, prices are not increased.<p>

<b>Mindcrafters</b> &ndash; Mindcrafters possess really unique Mindcraft abilities no other class can ever obtain. The <tt>Ctrl-i</tt> command is used to invoke Mindcraft. 
More on the Mindcraft abilities in section <a href="adomgb-0-5.html#053">0.5.3</a>. Mindcrafters have extremely hard time learning spells from books.<p>

<b>Monks</b> &ndash; Monks are expert kickers. They start off with a base damage of 1d10 to kicking, which increases as they gain levels &ndash; but lose the bonuses if
Burdened or worse. They cannot injure themselves by kicking the air or wall. They cannot true berserk under any circumstances. Their food consumption is about half
the rate of other classes. Monks do not lose Mana when writing scrolls. They start with no gold, except when picking the "Wealthy" talents.<p>

<b>Necromancers</b> &ndash; The manual states that level 50 Necromancers can return from the dead if their Toughness is greater than 10. It goes on to say that
they lose one-half of their Toughness when this happens. It does not mention that if their equipment keeps their Toughness at 10 or more, they can do this indefinitely.
Necromancers suffer from low dice modifiers on their skills, finding difficulties to advance Concentration, limited by a 1d3 or 1d5 modifier. Of equal importance for
Necromancers is Food Preservation, similarly limited. In contrast, Rangers, Bards and Beastfighters can expect very high 4d5 modifiers on most of their skills.
Necromancers also need 100% more marks to increase weapon skills. Like Wizards, Necromancers find all spells (including Wish) in the Library. Finally, they can perform
Necromancy very efficiently &ndash; see <a href="adomgb-0-11.html#0b7">0.11.7</a>, and are able to issue commands to their slaves without fail (via <tt>Ctrl+x</tt>).<p>

<b>Paladins</b> and <b>Priests</b> cannot use their class powers if they do not have enough piety with their deity (very pleased or better). They also find more
spellbooks, and get more piety from sacrifices (+20%/+50%). Paladins have prayers 33% cheaper. Priests need 50% more marks to increase weapon skills. Paladins do 
double damage with Justifier.<p>

<b>Rangers</b> &ndash; Rangers do not receive the -6 penalty to-hit on each weapon when fighting with two weapons, like other classes do.<p>

<b>Thieves</b> &ndash; Along with Dark Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves, Thieves have easier time finding secret doors. And they are masters when it comes to traps (Level*2 bonus to 
Detect Traps skill). <big>They get increased damage from backstabbing with daggers.</big><p>

<b>Weaponsmiths</b> &ndash; Your PC can never start out burdened &ndash; Strength will be raised enough so that the PC can handle the weight. Weaponsmiths start with a very
heavy 1000s anvil; this can give weaker races, like Hurthlings, a large, free Strength boost. Weaponsmiths of course have easier time Smithing &ndash; section 
<a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f4">0.15.4</a>.<p>

<b>Wizards</b> &ndash; Wizards born under the Salamander birthsign always start with spellbook of Fire Bolt. Wizards have easier time writing scrolls. They find more spellbooks
than other classes, and they find all spellbokks in the Library, including Wish. On the negative side, Wizards require twice as many weapon marks to advance weapon skill levels.<p>

<b>Beastfighters</b> and <b>Monks</b> increase their Speed, DV, to-hit and damage with level.
Beastfighters lose their bonuses if using weapons or shields, and also get /4 penalty to to-hit, dmg, and DV if using them. Monks get no bonuses if Burdened or worse, wearing 
a shield, or an armor other than robe, black robe, clean robe, clothes, elven chain mail, Shirt of the Saints, Robes of Resistance, <big>or wearing armor heavier than 60s</big>.
The Speed bonus for both classes is lvl/2, to-hit bonus is lvl*2 + lvl/3 - (lvl-1)/5 - 1. Beastfighter's damage is 1d(4+lvl/3*2) + lvl/2+lvl/4, Monk's damage is 1d(8+lvl) + lvl/4.
Beastfighters get +1 DV every third level, Monks get +1 DV in two levels out of three. Monks get also bonuses to kicking if not wielding weapons (they start with 1d10).<p>

<b>Elementalists</b> &ndash; Elementalists suffer from low dice modifiers on their skills, similarly to Necromancers. They also need 100% more marks to increase weapon skills.
They have unique ability to gain access and increase knowledge in certain spells according to the following table:<p>

</table><p>

<div class="resb">
<b>Chaos Knights</b> &ndash; Chaos Knights are the most unique class. They start out with extremely high PV, are very strong and tough, and are eligible for some extremely powerful
crowning gifts. Now on the worse side. Their class powers are recalculated each turn. They start with 3 corruptions. If chaotic, most useful NPC's will simply ignore them. This
includes all inhabitants of Terinyo, Arena, Dwarftown, and more. Furthermore, Tywat Pare, Garth, and Rolf will never offer their services or quests, even if they turn neutral or
lawful. If neutral, they are unable to use any class powers, take fire damage every 5 turns (need fire resistance), and get -2 to all attributes. If lawful, even more fire damage
(need fire immunity) and further -2 to all attributes. Finally, Chaos Knights shall not attempt ordinary ending, since that results in disaster
(section <a href="adomgb-4.html#44">4.4</a>).<p>

<b>Duelists</b> &ndash; Duelists cannot activate or benefit from any class powers if wearing a shield, dualwielding, wielding a two-handed weapon, wearing heavy armor (250s is
the limit), or if Burdened or worse. If these conditions are met, Duelists get bonuses of +1 to-hit and +1 to damage per two skill levels for their wielded weapon. They require
20% less weapon marks for one handed weapons except Polearms, but train much harder in other weapon categories (and Shields) and need over 10 times the usual amount of marks for
missile weapons.<p>

Heir is a talent that adds a particular item to the PC's starting inventory if selected. The type of item depends on the class of the PC; for some classes, it may also depend
on the PC's race. It is always blessed. Heir can only be picked as a starting talent and has two prerequisite talents (Boon to the Family and Charming). Therefore the PC can
only receive the talent if she starts with three or more talents.<p>

<h4 id="015">0.1.5 History</h4>
Four paragraphs describe history (or <tt>B</tt>ackground): information about parents, childhood, youthhood, and young adulthood. All of these are pretty random and have little
significance &ndash; different descriptions probably modify slightly starting attributes. Additional research is needed on this topic.<p>

not available in the free version, which is always played with "standard Roguelike" settings. Multiplier is for the final score.<p>

The Deluxe version also offers several more modes to play the game, with separate high score lists for Standard mode, Network game, and Weekly challenge:
<ul>
<li><b>Standard mode:</b> debilitating hunger, advantaged balance, and predefined talents.
<li><b>Tutorial mode:</b> Standard mode with hints and Tutorial Dungeon. You play as Human Fighter with random star sign. This mode is also available in the free version.  
<li><b>Exploration mode:</b> start with a blessed wand of wishing with 42 charges. No score here.
<li><b>Network game:</b> the difficulty of the monsters is dynamically adjusted based on how many of the player's Steam friends are playing ADOM. 
<li><b>Weekly challenge:</b> predefined character with varied game setup (which changes weekly) plays Ironman in the Infinite Dungeon, meaning you are forcefully drawn
towards stairs leading downwards. Moving away from them after having discovered them causes damage.
