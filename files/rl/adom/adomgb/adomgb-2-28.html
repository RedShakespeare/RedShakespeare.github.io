<h3>Stone Dragon Caves</h3>
The Stone Dragon Caves only appear after the PC obtains Rolf quest (section <a href="adomgb-2-27.html#2r52">2.27.5.2</a>). They consist of five levels in total. All levels
have a reduced line of sight (similar to the Water Dragon Cave), allow digging and teleportation, and are subject to earthquakes at random intervals. The caves are populated
by all types of earth and stone monsters, as well as baby stone dragons, stone dragons, ancient stone dragons, and great stone wyrms. The first four levels have cavernous
layouts, while the final level has a special layout that includes the Stone Dragon King's treasure hoard.<p>

All stone dragons feature special stone breath attack, which deals non-elemental damage to the PC, and can destroy items not made of mithril, adamantium, eternium, truesilver, or crystal.
There does not appear to be any way to reduce the stone damage. All the dragons are also immune to acid, cold, and lightning, they bounce or absorb all magic bolts (including fire bolt),
and drop pile of trasure when killed. Great stone wyrms in addition cast confusion, cone of cold, and darkness.<p>

Toughness scores of 1, it cannot be activated. If it is used while the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire is in the PC's inventory, it will cause volcanoes to spawn throughout the Drakalor Chain,
