<h3>Random dungeons</h3>
Random dungeons were introduced in ADOM R+. They can be found and entered via the wilderness map. Some aspects of these dungeons, such as their respective depths and DL ranges, are consistent 
between games, but their actual locations vary throughout different games. Some of the dungeons may be generated in the north-western part of the Drakalor Chain and thus may require a climbing 
set to reach.<p>

Various dungeon features may be encountered in these dungeons. Thus, low-DL caves might be scouted for herbs early in the game and altars and forges to use later in the game. The Putrid Cave
might be of high interest for players who place high value in early precrowning which may be trivial to do if an altar is generated on one of its levels.<p>

6 random dungeons appear in every game. Their shorthand descriptions, depths, and DL ranges are fixed.<p>

<h4 id="2l1">2.21.1 Tome of Donors <tt>"</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item738.png" alt="tod" align="left">
It is generated on the fifth level of the Moldy Dungeon if all of the following conditions are met: the PC has gained less than 90,160 experience points, less than 90,160 turns have passed,
and the PC is carrying less than 90,160 gold pieces. Otherwise, a useless <b>ruined libram</b> is generated in its place. It is guarded by a somewhat experienced stone golem along with a
pile of 9016 gold pieces.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>

Weight: 500s

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d8 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d8 points of damage.

The Tome of Donors is a guaranteed artifact book that may be read to gain a random beneficial effect. If the tome is cursed, or the PC is of chaotic alignment, reading it will not have any
effect. Once read, it cannot be read again for a number of turns; this number increases the more times it is read, also depending on the effect the increase of turns can be small, medium,
or high. Maximum cooldown is 10000 turns. In its unidentified form it is described as "lavish libram". Reading the tome for the first time produces the following description:<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You seem to have discovered the legendary tome of donors. This tome is said to collect 
the legends of all Ancardian heroes that donated their blood, souls, and lives in order 
to ward off past incursions of Chaos. Some succeeded, some failed, but they have all 
become legends. You start paging through the tome and discover a story...</pre></table><p>

This text does not appear on any consecutive readings. If the tome is currently "locked", attempting to read it will produce the following message: 

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You fail to open the tome of donors. It seems to be locked by some unknown force!</pre></table><p>
