<h3>Water Dragon Cave</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-13-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Water Dragon Cave is located in a random water-containing tile of the wilderness. The location of the cave is not decided until the PC starts <tt>s</tt>earching for it,
so it is more or less possible to place it in a convenient location, such as near Terinyo. Fire damage in the cave is greatly reduced. It contains Shyssiryxius,
the great water dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various other aquatic beasts <tt>A</tt>. The entire cave is submerged, so ordinarily some means of water breathing
(section <a href="adomgb-0-12.html#0c17">0.12.1.7</a>) and the Swimming skill are required. If the PC is not born with the Swimming skill, it can be obtained from Blup
by giving him potions of carrot juice. The need for these abilities ordinarily keeps low level PCs out of the cave, which is as it should be. In theory a PC with on
demand teleportation, high hit points and possibly some regeneration could survive a teleport to Shyssiryxius (36 tiles to the left), a chat and a teleport to the up
stairs without water breathing or Swimming. <p>

There are two main reasons for entering:<p>
 
1. The first is to <tt>C</tt>hat with Shyssiryxius then return to Terinyo. This allows the PC to inform Blup about the location of his mother, which results
in eventual delivery of the Rune-Covered Trident later in the game (see later). If Shyssiryxius is killed before Blup has been informed of her whereabouts,
the PC will not receive the Rune-Covered Trident; however, once Blup has been informed, she can be killed even if the trident has not yet arrived without
forfeiting it &ndash; she already sent it, after all.<p>

2. The second reason for entering the cave is to loot it. There are occasionally outstanding items found in the treasure hoard. As might be expected, Shyssiryxius
does not take kindly to thieves and will attack. In addition, no items may be picked up anywhere in the cave without angering the dragon. If the PC picks up an item,
she will immediately teleport next to the PC and attack. This includes items that the PC drops, items from monsters killed, or missiles shot. Valuable missile weapons
should therefore generally not be used. She does not see in darkness, however. Cast Darkness over desired item(s), pick them up and leave.<p>

<div class="resb">Robbing the lair with the use of darkness is not safe anymore, as Shyssiryxius will be next to PC most of the time and can easily attack her.
She won't use water breath attack, but her melee capabilities are equally powerful. High DV/PV values are advised and maintaining maximum hit points at all times
should be a top priority.<p>
</div>

3. Third reason might to be to tame some aquatic monsters. Monsters tamed in the underwater cave can leave with the PC and breathe air. This is probably a game bug.<p>

<h4 id="2d1">2.13.1 Aquatic monsters <tt>A</tt>&nbsp;<tt>E</tt></h4>
The aquatic beasts found in the labyrinth are not trivial, especially the (giant) dragon turtles. Note that having water breathing intrinsic reduces water breath damage.
Sharks, giant eels, and (greater) water elementals can also be found. None of these monsters see in darkness or invisible (except Shyssiryxius).<p>

<h4 id="2d2">2.13.2 Shyssiryxius, the great water dragon <tt>D</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/286.png" alt="Shyssiryxius, the great water dragon" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 70, PV: 40, Hits: 1140, Attacks: 3, Damage: 6d15+12, Speed: 120.</table>
Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only intimidating. If she is <tt>C</tt>hatted with, she roars "HAST YE SEEN MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done
something to make her hostile). Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after chatting and report back to Blup. This of course assumes a PC facing her when she is
hostile survives (see below). However killing her before talking to Blup makes him angry and forfeits the quest.<p>

If the PC attempts to steal from her treasure hoard (pickup anything rom the ground), she gives a warning about not picking anything up. If the PC persists, she will attack.
She is a formidable opponent with a reasonably powerful melee attack and a deadly water breath attack that is capable of dealing about 100 points of damage in a single round.
Sources of water breathing will reduce the damage of this attack. She regenerates and is immune to cold. She is capable of teleporting and does so when she panics, making the
PC work to find her while remaining underwater the whole time. She can be killed, but it takes an upper level PC, and it doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions of ultra/extra
healing along. She is vulnerable to darkness and poison.<p>

<h4 id="2d3">2.13.3 Rune-Covered Trident <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item447.png" alt="rct" align="left">
The Rune-Covered Trident is a decent artifact weapon and missile. The trident will arrive by a water elemental messenger not long after reaching character level 16 for PCs
born under the Raven starsign. Others have to wait until level 36.<p style="clear:none">

One of the most powerful guaranteed artifact weapons in the game, though its most unfortunate property is that for non-Raven characters it will likely appear a bit too late
to make a lasting difference. Still, its demon slaying properties can be of considerable value in fighting some of the late-game monsters, notably balors, even then.
Raven-born characters should make an effort to receive it at the earliest point possible, at which point it is sure to be a tremendous asset.<p>

Characters that have the luxury of using a more powerful artifact in melee might want to use it as a thrown weapon against demons and undead; they can train the Thrown
spears weapon skill using spears of returning or large stacks of regular spears.<p>
