<h3>Tower of Eternal Flames</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-5-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>
The Tower of Eternal Flames, found in the wilderness location in the middle-left region of the map, not far from the CoC and Darkforge, is probably the nastiest
place in the game given the experience level of PCs who must visit it.<p>

PCs are denied entrance to the lower CoC until they have the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm in the ToEF, and the game stalls at this point.
PCs can continue to gain experience levels by staying on available cavernous levels (for instance) in order to have a better chance in the Tower. Ultimately, however,
boredom will set in and the PC will have to face the Tower. Obtaining the Fire Orb is a huge hurdle to get over and marks a division between the earlier,
beginning parts of the game and the latter parts of the game. Some players also believe it marks the division between beginning and advanced players.<p>

The objective in the ToEF is of course the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. It is held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm who can be found on the top level of the ToEF.
This level is typical of the levels containing elemental temples. The temple itself occupies half of the level and is disconnected. It can only be reached
by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Since a PC may have her only means of digging destroyed on her way through the tower, praying on the top
level will result in a pickaxe gift from the PC's god. The piety level required is 15,000 piety. The PC must not be Doomed or Cursed. If using artifacts
that grant those intrinsics, remove them.<p>

There is chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous.
The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should she step on it. In addition, they can only be converted
by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an Ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.<p>

<h4 id="251">2.5.1 Fire damage</h4>
The Tower of Eternal Flames consists of four levels. They are all very, very hot. This causes damage to both the PC and her equipment, whether worn or inventory.
To protect the PC, fire resistance or immunity is necessary. See section <a href="adomgb-0-12.html#0c11">0.12.1.1</a> about fire resistance.<p>

To protect the PC (other than Drakelings, see below) completely from the heat in the ToEF, the PC must have four sources of fire resistance. Note that
intrinsic fire resistance counts as two sources. Thus, for example, a PC with intrinsic fire resistance wearing a ring of fire resistance under the Elemental
Gauntlets would take no damage from the heat in the Tower.<p>

The fire damage PC takes is the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>no fire resistance &ndash; 10 dmg per turn
<li>1 source &ndash; 2 dmg per turn
<li>2 sources &ndash; 1 dmg per turn
<li>3 sources &ndash; 1 dmg per 2 turns
<li>4+ sources &ndash; no damage
</ul><p>

If the player has the Immune to Pain talent, two resistances are enough.<p>

There are a number of artifacts that grant fire resistance or immunity. Guaranteed examples include the Elemental Gauntlets, the Black Torc (curses), the Ring of the
High Kings (all grant resistance), the Shield of Raw Steel (immunity, but corrupts) and the Crown of Science (immunity, but also dooms and curses). Assaulting the Tower with
these intrinsics is a dangerous choice, of course. It is difficult enough without them. There are several other nonguaranteed artifacts which grant resistance or
immunity to fire. It is worth remembering that artifacts are indestructible and so cannot be damaged by the heat in the Tower.<p>

The heat in the Tower will destroy equipment that is vulnerable to fire. This includes most items that are not made of the higher metals mithril,
adamantium and eternium. Rings of fire resistance will not be damaged. Weapons and armor with the red prefix are also impervious to heat.<p>

If a PC must wear items vulnerable to fire, a blessed ring of ice is necessary. Uncursed rings of ice will not work, they must be blessed. Even with a blessed
ring of ice, some equipment destruction may occur. Blessed rings of ice seem to protect to the 92-95% level. Even wearing two blessed rings of ice does not
guarantee worn equipment will not be destroyed, although the protection seems to go up to 99+%. A ring of ice is of course not necessary if the PC wears only
artifacts and items made of the higher metals. Missiles are an obvious problem. It is rare to find enough arrows made from higher metals to satisfy an Archer in
the ToEF, for instance. Even rocks are vulnerable to the heat, sometimes exploding. Non-artifact slings, bows and crossbows are liable to be burnt or melted.<p>

One thing to remember &ndash; rings are never destroyed until the gauntlets worn over them are destroyed. Since the artifact Elemental Gauntlets are available to all
PCs, this provides a foolproof means of protecting nonartifact rings.<p>

<h4 id="252">2.5.2 Drakelings in the ToEF</h4>
Drakelings <big>and PCs with cold blood corruption</big> face special problems in the ToEF. The Mad Minstrel sings a song about this. Drakelings, even those with fire immunity,
always take damage in the ToEF. This is not because of the heat itself but is a secondary effect due to the greatly increased metabolism Drakelings will suffer from in the ToEF.
There is no way around it. In order to survive, Drakelings must have a means of regeneration or healing in the ToEF. Ideally an artifact that causes
regeneration should be worn. An alternative is to bring blessed potions of extra healing along. It is possible for Drakelings to do the ToEF with only
three or four blessed PoEH if everything is done efficiently with no wasted time. In exchange, they gain huge amounts of Speed (300+) over time which will give them
3 or 4 actions before enemies can move.<p>

One technique Drakelings (and other races for that matter) can use is to read a blessed scroll of magic mapping upon entering a new level of the ToEF followed
by teleportation to the up stairway. Obviously the PC must have the necessary scrolls, wands or spell and teleport control.<p>

<h4 id="253">2.5.3 ToEF monsters</h4>
This whole situation is very vexing, because the ToEF contains a very nasty collection of monsters and the PC naturally wants to bring her best equipment,
but at the same time does not want it destroyed.<p>

Monsters (except possible tension rooms or vaults) who can be generated in the ToEF consist of the following: fire beetle <tt>i</tt>, fire lizard <tt>l</tt> (double chance), fire drake
<tt>D</tt> (thrice chance), fire giant <tt>H</tt> (thrice chance), fire giant king <tt>H</tt>, fire demon <tt>&amp;</tt>, fire grue <tt>x</tt>, fire elemental <tt>E</tt>,
red baby dragon <tt>D</tt>, red dragon <tt>D</tt>, red worm <tt>w</tt> (double chance).<p>

<img src="tiles/138.png" alt="red baby dragon"><img src="tiles/142.png" alt="red dragon"><img src="tiles/234.png" alt="red worm"><br>

The temple itself is occupied by problematic monsters. Fire demons and fire grues in particular are annoying because they have a corrupting melee attack with a very high to-hit.
Even PCs with excellent DV will be hit eventually. Taken as a whole, this means that invisibility is very, very desirable in the Fire Temple. The only temple monsters that see in
darkness are fire demons and the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. It is most useful for fighting the elementals. It is probably wise to dispel the darkness before tackling the ACW.<p>

The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, the key to the lower parts of the CoC. It is immune to paralysis, confusion, and stunning. It has a fire breath
attack and a corrupting melee attack. In addition it is able to cast confusion and energy ray. It is also able to heal its wounds. The ACW can be killed in a variety of ways including
brute force, although it is preferable to attack it from a distance due to its corrupting melee attack. The ACW is vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo. If it is killed on the
temple's altar, be extraordinarily careful! If the PC is visible the fire demons will sacrifice her instantly. Even if the PC is invisible, fire demons
who have been engaged in melee will "know" where the PC is and sacrifice her. The safest thing to do is <tt>k</tt>ick anything dropped on the altar to an adjacent
tile before picking it up.<p>

<h4 id="255">2.5.5 Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire <tt>]</tt></h4>

The ACW holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, which is one of the five Orbs that are mandatory for completing the game. As such, it can't be sold or lost by any means.<p style="clear:none">

Whilst worn in the tool slot, the orb raises Strength by 10. It can also be <tt>U</tt>sed to replicate the Fireball spell;
though doing so adds 300 corruption points (150 with Elemental Gauntlets equipped). Note that while it can also be used
as a melee or missile weapon, wielding it as such won't confer the Strength bonus.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
-------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} -------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your strength attribute by +10.
