This level is found on D: 33 or D: 34. You will know when you find it, because the level message "You suddenly sense an intense tension." is generated. It consists of a long northern corridor
connected to a long southern corridor. Traversing these corridors allows time for the inhabitants of the level, battle bunnies <tt>r</tt>, to breed. It produces more battle bunnies, as well as
slightly more dangerous mutated battle bunnies. This is to be avoided as they breed like, well, rabbits. It can quickly get out of control. The best way to deal with the level is to immediately
tunnel (or teleport) south by any means at the PC's disposal and kill Bugs, the leader of the level. This drastically reduces or eliminates further breeding of the bunnies. Kill the remainder and
descend. Note that scrolls of vermin control do not work on the level, instead exploding to produce a green cloud of foul smoke.<p>

A PC who has many castings of Cure Light Wounds (or some other healing spell and the power points to support it reasonably, Cure Light Wounds is the least costly) can exploit
the Battle Bunny level for an extremely quick and easy way to achieve L+ alignment.<p>

I'm not completely sure of the mechanics of their breeding, but I assume from observation that the Battle Bunnies do something in the context of reducing their hitpoints by half
when they breed (needs testing from a PC that has a blessed stethescope). For every Battle Bunny that reproduces, you get two Battle Bunnies that are injured, and thus are viable for
healing for lawful alignment boost. Once the PC is done healing a Battle Bunny, you can kill off each one healed and then be surrounded by more injured Battle Bunnies which you can heal
for even more alignment boosts.<p>

Try to make sure Bugs is near while doing this, so that he may be killed once the PC has no more use for rapidly breeding Battle Bunnies. This is especially an option to consider for high
level Wizards, who will be guaranteed access to every spell in the game at the Library, including healing spells and anything else the PC might need to make her job easier.<p>

Using Calm Monster on the Battle Bunnies if you're trying to stay lawful is a silly idea because you cannot <tt>:s</tt>wap positions with them even if they are non-hostile.<p>

The rate at which battle bunnies breed on the level is increased whilst Bugs is alive; so PCs are advised to kill him as soon as possible. He can disarm PCs in melee range, but is not very tough
or dangerous for the stage in the game he is found (particularly since the PC has to defeat the Ancient Chaos Wyrm to get this far).<p>

<span class="newb">Bugs drops a wand of bunny summoning when killed. When zapped, it summons a battle bunny into an adjacent space. It there is no room for the bunny, there is no effect. The wand
is fairly useless &mdash; the summoned bunny is not even likely to be friendly.<p></span>
