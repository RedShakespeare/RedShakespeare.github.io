<h3>Tomb of the High Kings</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-12-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Tomb of the High Kings is located in a dungeon found in the northwest corner of the Drakalor Chain. Players typically venture to the dungeon in search of the
Ring of the High Kings, since this is generally the safest method of passing the Eternal Guardian in the lower CoC. The PC must have a climbing set to reach it
(and to leave that section of the map). Dropping your climbing set in the staircase immediately before descending past the first level is a good idea,
to prevent it from getting destroyed by traps/breath attacks and thus leave you trapped here until you find another one. The fact that a climbing set
is required means that the PC must do some work to find one prior to entering the dungeon. This ensures that brand new PCs do not enter this location.
The dungeon consists of two normal levels followed by three cavernous levels leading to the tomb. The cavernous levels are somewhat challenging, as
are most cavernous levels.<p>

The tomb itself consists of a short winding corridor leading to a large chamber. The chamber contains a lake which is unique in that the water is
red rather than blue. This should serve as a warning. It is filled with chaos piranhas that deal 100d4 points of damage during each turn the PC
is in the lake. This is the place where the Bridge Building skill or the ability to freeze water (yielded by the Terinyo quests) becomes vital.<p>

Teleportation is not allowed on this level, so do not count on it to get your PC out of a tight spot.<p>

The PC must build a bridge or create an ice bridge to an island located in the lake. Remember that ice bridges will only hold the PC's weight plus
2000 stones before breaking. Anything that freezes water will work including monsters (section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d81">0.13.8.1</a>)
On the island is a 1x1 room protected by a locked and trapped door. Upon opening the door, a skeletal king is found guarding the Ring of the High Kings.<p>

<div class="newb">
Later versions of the game add two convenient means of crossing the water safely: using Levitating status or staff of parting water. Since there are no random
monsters generated on this level, waiting for the staff to recharge between uses takes little real-world time using the <tt>w5</tt> command, so it doesn't take
much effort to clear a large safe area in the middle of the lake.<p>

<img src="tiles/405.png" alt="Skeletal King" align="left">

The Skeletal King is a somewhat nasty foe who can cast glowing balls and is able to confuse the PC. This is not a good thing when the PC is perched on a bridge, liable to stumble to
certain death in the piranha infested waters below. Some means of confusion resistance is therefore highly recommended. The Skeletal King is immune to the chaos piranhas so
luring him into the lake will not kill him. He is vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course. He is not difficult to kill in melee for a mid-level PC with a decent melee attack.
He never summons help on his own level, but if lured off the level, he will. <big>In R+, he can summon skeletal warriors anywhere.</big> He does not see invisible.<p>

<h4 id="2c2">2.12.2 Ring of the High Kings <tt>=</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item453.png" alt="rothk" align="left">
The objective of this dungeon, the Ring of the High Kings, allows peaceful passage past the Eternal Guardian (section <a href="adomgb-3-12.html">3.12</a>).
Its unidentified form is "platinum ring". It grants a few resistances and a small boost to DV/PV ratings, which may make it worth wearing in general, although most PCs are likely
to find something better.<p style="clear:none">

Note that it is not necessary to kill the Skeletal King to claim the Ring of the High Kings. The ring is lying on the floor of the room where the Skeletal King is first found,
so in principle it is possible to lure the king away, grab the ring, and make a hasty retreat.<p>
