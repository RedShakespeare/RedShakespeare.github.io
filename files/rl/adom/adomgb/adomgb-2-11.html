<h3>Assassins' Guild</h3>
The Assassins' Guild is located in the wilderness, west of the river that divides the Drakalor Chain, near the center of the map just down the road from the Pyramid.
The entrance is described as "A rather boring cave entrance." It consists of three levels, separated into the DDL, VDDL, and the Assassins' Guild, named ????.<p>

<h4 id="2b1">2.11.1 DDL</h4>
The first level is named DDL (Dusty Dungeon Level) and contains no unique special features, although it may contain any of the normal dungeon features: traps, herbs, rivers, etc.<p>

<h4 id="2b2">2.11.2 VDDL</h4>
<img src="tiles/trap_t.png" alt="tele trap" align="left"><img src="tiles/item171.png" alt="tele wand" align="left">
Upon entering the second level, the message "This dungeon is very dusty." is generated. This VDDL (Very Dusty Dungeon Level) level contains many, many teleportation
traps and can be annoying without teleport control. It also contains one guaranteed item: wand of teleportation <tt>\</tt>. This is generally a very useful item to have.
The wand is always next to the down staircase found on the level in a 1x2 room that is separated from the rest of the level. It can only be reached by digging or teleportation.
In practice, the easiest way to find the
down staircase is to zap wand of item detection, or read scroll of item detection. This will reveal the location of the wand, which the PC can then dig or teleport to,
thus revealing the staircase. Alternatively scroll of magic mapping will reveal the location of the down staircase. Note that it is possible for a monster to be standing
on the wand, so teleportation may fail. Lucky or persistent players may even be able to teleport to the wand with a random teleport.<p>

<h4 id="2b21">2.11.2.1 Hidden stairway and how to descend</h4>
The hidden down staircase in the VDDL is like no other in the game. It is itself a teleportation trap and will attempt to teleport the PC away when she tries to
descend. Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating without teleport control. There is a requirement to trigger 42 of the far teleportation traps or trigger
the stairs 250 times before the PC can descend. Just keep trying until the PC receives the message "You suddenly feel attuned to this area in a very special way."
It is then possible to descend to the Assassins' Guild on the third level.<p>

<h4 id="2b3">2.11.3 Final level</h4>
<a href="adomgb-2-11-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The final level of the Assassins' Guild has no proper name; it is only named with four question marks: "????". There are definite precautions necessary on this
level. The PC initially descends into a 3x3 room containing four assassins. The assassins are not particularly dangerous opponents, although they use poison.
There is a safe passage available through the level which is free of traps, otherwise the level is full of traps. The PC <i>must not</i> use missile weapons on
the level. If she does, a general alarm is sounded and the Assassin Prince, who is very important for special endings, becomes hostile and refuses to give
quests later in the game. Likewise, a failed pickpocket attempt, or attempting to pickpocket the same assassin twice, will raise the general alarm.
Also be careful during melee. If an assassin panics, leave him alone. Attacking panic-stricken assassins will also make the Assassin Prince hostile. In their
panicked state, they may begin attacking each other or the Assassin Prince himself. Pay no attention to them.<p>

Teleportation is not allowed on this level. Obviously, there are some nasty monsters here and there is no particular objective for low-level PCs, other than killing the
monsters for experience. The PC may elect to skip this level until much later in the game.<p>

The final level contains assassins <tt>@</tt>, master assassins <tt>@</tt>, muggers <tt>@</tt>, holy slayers <tt>X</tt>, gray slayers <tt>X</tt>, doppelgangers <tt>@</tt>
and doppelganger lords <tt>@</tt>.<p>

The Assassin Prince is the source of the Filk Quest, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel. This quest is only necessary for the Ultra endings. See section <a href="adomgb-4.html#4311">4.3.1.1</a> for a
description of this quest and its requirements. If a PC is not planning to do an Ultra ending, it may be worth killing the Assassin Prince for the artifact dagger
Sting, which he carries. Note two things: the Assassin Prince has been described as the offspring of a moloch and a quickling queen &ndash; he's not quite that bad, but
he is a very difficult opponent that ignores PV and uses poison &ndash; and second, Sting is really only worth acquiring if the PC has or plans to obtain its companion dagger Needle,
available from Sharad-Waador (section <a href="adomgb-3-19.html">3.19</a>).<p>

<h4 id="2b32">2.11.3.2 Sting <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item614.png" alt="sting" align="left">
On its own, it is quite useless. Used together with Needle, it receives a bonus of 50 to to-hit and damage making it,
essentially, a (+58, 3d4+50) weapon without any other factors taken in. Needle receives the same bonus, making the combination
of the two truly stunning in performance.<p>

<table style="clear:left" class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
----------- black rune-covered dagger "Sting" (+8, 3d4) [+4, +1] ----------

Weight: 10s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +1.

When used in melee combat it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 3d4 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 3d4 points of damage.

(Needle has the same base properties, but Needle + Sting grant +50 to hit and
damage when dual-wielded)
