<h2 id="H">Talents</h2>
Each character in ADOM has one or more talents representing inborn
strengths and abilities that favor the character in some special way. A
character receives one or more talents at the time of character creation
(depending on several factors, among them race, profession, star signs and
special luck) and also steadily gain new talents while advancing in level:
every third level a new talent is gained.<p>

While talents sometimes are independent of each other, at other times they
depend on prerequisites. These prerequisites can be highly variable: race,
profession, attribute scores, level, skills and other things are possible.<p>

By selecting talents in a special order, you will be able to focus on
certain key areas and thus gain access to very powerful yet highly
specialized talents. By remaining unfocused you can choose from a wide
variety of talents and thus remain flexible.<p>

If no talents are available (because you don't meet the prerequisites),
your choices are lost.<p>

<h3 id="H1">Starting Talents</h3>
The initial number of talents is determined according to the following
rules:<p>
<ul>
<li>Every character receives one base talent.
<li>Characters born under the sign of Falcon or Candle receive one free talent.
<li>Characters with a Mana score of 18 or more receive one free talent.
<li><big>Humans</big>, gnomes and hurthlings receive one free talent.
<li>Bards, merchants and farmers receive one free talent.
<li>Characters whose sum of attributes is divisible by 7 receive one free talent (this represents some inborn magical luck or talent).
</ul><p>

<h3 id="H2">Cumulative Talents</h3>
All talent effects are cumulative, e.g. they add up or multiply (depending on the special effect in question).<p>

<h3 id="H4">Shaping Characters with Talents</h3>
The initial talent choices can make a vast difference in how your character
plays. Talents allow both very narrow specializations (if you e.g. select
only talents that increase your power points) or widely knowledgable
characters.<p>

<h3 id="H5">Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Talents in ADOM</h3>
ADOM Deluxe (<a href="http://www.adom.de/steam">http://www.adom.de/steam</a>) offers several modes of working with
talents:<p>
<ul>
<li>You can select all talents for your character by yourself. This offers
the best customizability but also forces you understand and know the many
available talents. Additionally it adds a pretty time-consuming step to
character generation. Recommended for advanced players!
<li>You can allow ADOM to select predefined talents for you. ADOM has an
internal selection of talents based on your chosen profession and will
select from that list.
<li>You can deactivate talents completely (if you find neither the first nor
the second option enjoyable).
</ul><p>

ADOM Classic always makes you choose your talents yourself.<p>
