<h3>Borderland Settlement</h3>
<a href="adomgb-1-9-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Borderland Settlement is a town which appears east of the Caverns of Chaos after 8,000 turns have passed. It contains a potion shop, and a lawful altar.
In addition to some townsfolk, it is populated by mercenaries that will become companions for a fee (about 100-1000 gp). The bishop of order in the temple
gives some hints about the main quest line. The DL of the settlement is 10, causing background corruption, which is unusual for a surface town. This can be
remedied with a scroll of peace.<p>

The paladins of order, bishop of order, and monks of order are angered by the PC converting, attempting to convert, kicking the altar, sacrificing a lawful monster,
or by talking to the bishop of order while crowned Chaotic. Otherwise, they and the shopkeeper are indifferent to the other inhabitants of the level.<p>

He guards the temple in the Borderland Settlement. Attacking other "of order" monsters or converting or attempting to convert the altar there will anger him,
but he can be sacrificed if the altar is converted. He is able to cast energy ray and healing. In melee he can disarm and drains attributes. If peaceful, he
provides hints on making progress on the main quest when chatted with.<p>
