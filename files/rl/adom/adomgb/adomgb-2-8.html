<h3>Mad Minstrel's clearing</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-8-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The clearing is found in the northern central part of the wilderness map.<p>

<h4 id="281">2.8.1 Mad Minstrel <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/320.png" alt="Mad Minstrel" align="left">

The Mad Minstrel lives in a hut. As he wanders about, he will randomly drop corpses that correspond to the danger level of the level he is on. In his own clearing,
he drops mainly goblin, orc, and bat corpses. If one leads him a few steps over to the Bug-Infested Temple, he will drop plenty of dragon and giant corpses.
Pretty safe, but at least one greater bug will have to be killed first. That's not difficult though, as any offensive wand will work nicely. To get the Mad Minstrel
out of his glade, order a companion to attack him when he is close to the map border. The PC can then switch places with the pet, and the Mad Minstrel will come to stand
on the border. Careful with pet type though, as if it's too weak it will die in one hit.<p>

The Mad Minstrel is a critical part of the special endings. More about his role in the special endings can be found in section <a href="adomgb-4.html#4312">4.3.1.2</a>.<p>

Additionally, the Ghost Librarian will assign the PC to deliver the Weird Tome to the Mad Minstrel, who will give the PC five cursed scroll of chaos
resistance <big>corruption removal</big> in return.<p>

<h4 id="282">2.8.2 Mad Minstrel's songs</h4>
The Mad Minstrel will sing songs which are somewhat cryptic hints about important parts of the game. If a player wants to finish the game without reading extensive spoilers,
it is very important to sit through his concerts until the player has memorized everything he has to say. Alternatively, they are reproduced here along with some interpretation.<p>

The Song of the Mad Minstrel

"I am the thorn in the foot, I am the blur in the sight;
I am the worm at the root, I am the thief in the night.
I am the rat in the wall, the leper that leers at the gate;
I am the ghost in the hall, herald of horror and hate.

I am the rust on the corn, I am the smut on the wheat,
Laughing man's labor to scorn, weaving a web for his feet.
I am canker and mildew and blight, danger and death and decay;
The rot of the rain by night, the blast of the sun by day.

I warp and wither with drouth, I work in the swamp's foul yeast;
I bring the black plague from the south and the leprosy in from the east.
I rend from the hemlock boughs wine steeped in the petals of dooms;
Where the fat black serpents drowse I gather the Upas blooms.

I have plumbed the northern ice for a spell like Frozen lead;
In lost grey fields of rice, I have learned from Mongol dead.
Where a bleak black mountain stands I have looted grisly caves;
I have digged in the desert sands to plunder terrible graves.

Never the sun goes forth, never the moon glows red,
But out of the south or the north, I come with the slavering dead.
I come with hideous spells, black chants and ghastly tunes;
I have looted the hideen hells amd plundered the lost black moons.

There was never a king or priest to cheer me by word or look,
There was never a man or beast in the blood-black ways I took.
There were crimson gulfs unplumbed, there were black wings over a sea,
There were pits where mad things drummed, and foaming blasphemy.

There were vast ungodly tombs where slimy monsters dreamed;
There were clouds like blood-drenched plumes where unborn demons screamed.
There were ages dead to Time, and lands lost out of Space;
There were adders in the slime, and a dim unholy Face.

Oh, the heart in my breast turned stone, and the brain froze in my skull --
But I won through, I alone, and poured my chalice full
Of horrors and dooms and spells, black buds and bitter roots --
From the hells beneath the hells, I bring you my deathly fruits."

       "A drakelings scales may be crimson red
       if a creature of fire for dinner he had
    he may wear tough scales and two rings to boot
      he may have the armor and all of the loot
          but fire is still a hazard to him
  cause a drakeling will start to burn from within.

     He will become fast, even fast as the light
  his foes may run screaming at this unearthly sight
      as quicklings so fast, he may just become
      but the hazard of fire will never be gone
  cause the speed makes him dizzy and dazy and that
  and no ring and no scales will save him from that.

      So the tower of fire is a dangerous thing
and you should really listen to the sound of my string
   for a drakeling has really a hard time in there
   without healing and stuff he won't get anywhere.
      So a potion or herb might be a good boon,
