<h2 id="O">The Game</h2>
ADOM is started by typing<p>

<tt>adom</tt><p>

at your command prompt or by clicking on its icon or launching it via Steam
(for ADOM Deluxe, see <a href="http://www.adom.de/steam">http://www.adom.de/steam</a>).
After some moments the game will start.<p>

<h3 id="O1">Starting ADOM Classic</h3>
After passing the title screen, you will have to choose whether to start a
new game, restore a saved game or page through this manual.<p>

The restore option will provide you with a list of available saved games
from which you can restore a game. Please note that you can't restore a
game when your character died the last time you played (this is a staple of
roguelike gaming; ADOM Deluxe offers an option to save and restore games
even after dying).<p>

If you choose to create a new character, ADOM first of all will randomly
determine your birth date, your star sign and give some details about the
effects of the events surrounding your birth. Then you will have to decide
whether to choose a specific class and race to play or whether you want
ADOM to choose for you. In both cases you will have to determine the gender
of your character. This has some influence on game play (in ADOM female
characters are more agile, male characters are slightly stronger). If you
allow fate to decide the details, ADOM will randomly choose the race and
profession of your character, otherwise you will be presented with lists
for both from which you have to choose.<p>

Then you will have to enter a name for the character you are going to play.
The name has no further influence on game play but serves to individualize
your character. If you just press ENTER instead of entering a name, the
game will christen your character with a default name, if the variable
'Allow_Default_Names' is set to 'true' in 'adom.cfg'.<p>

Next, the background of your character will be described. The game will
mention your character's sex and race and then detail his life prior to
starting his adventure. Every character lives through four major phases of
development: early childhood, childhood, youth and young adulthood. For
each phase certain events are generated. These events serve to detail your
PC and influence his attributes. Finally, you will get to know your class,
your area of specialization (if available) and your starting age.<p>

After all this you will be dumped directly into the game. You are assumed
to have just entered one of the major valleys in the Drakalor Chain and
from that point on everything is based on your actions.<p>

<h3 id="O2">Starting ADOM Deluxe</h3>
ADOM Deluxe always starts in graphical mode (at least until you change the
settings).<p>

Note that you can switch ASCII and graphical display at any time by
pressing <tt>F10</tt>.

We recommend using the graphical mode until you feel comfortable with the
options provided by ADOM Deluxe as there are tons of options and choices
and these all are documented via tooltips and other means in the graphical
mode (and we won't repeat that information here).<p>

<h3 id="O3">Important Concepts</h3>
<h4 id="O31">The ADOM Classic Main Screen</h4>
Most of the time you will see the main game screen, which contains most of
the interesting information about your character, your surroundings and
your condition.<p>

The following sample shows how a game screen might look:

</pre>

The first two lines of the screens are reserved for messages which explain
certain events and actions. If more text is issued than fits into those two
lines, a (more) prompt will appear. To continue you have to press <tt>SPACE</tt> (or
<tt>Z</tt>). If you are expecting many messages in one turn which you don't want to
read, you also can press <tt>ENTER</tt>. All messages will scroll through without
waiting for a confirmation. If you want to look at one of those messages
later, you can still use the <tt>:m</tt> command (see below).<p>

The last three lines contain information about your character in the
following order:<p>
<ul>
<li>Name: Let's guess what this is :-)
<li><tt>St: </tt>The strength score of your character.
<li><tt>Le: </tt>The learning score of your character.
<li><tt>Wi: </tt>The willpower score of your character.
<li><tt>Dx: </tt>The dexterity score of your character.
<li><tt>To: </tt>The toughness score of your character.
<li><tt>Ch: </tt>The charisma score of your character.
<li><tt>Ap: </tt>The appearance score of your character.
<li><tt>Ma: </tt>The mana score of your character.
<li><tt>Pe: </tt>The perception score of your character.
<li><tt>DV: </tt>The defensive value of your character.
<li><tt>PV: </tt>The protection value of your character.
<li><tt>H: </tt>The hit points of your character.
<li><tt>P: </tt>The magical power points of your character.
<li><tt>Exp:</tt> The experience you have to collected up to now and your
experience level. The second number stands for the number of
experience points you already have earned, the first number
describes your current experience level.
<li><tt>D: </tt>A letter shortcut for the current dungeon followed (usually) by the
number of the current dungeon level.
<li><tt>Sp: </tt>The speed value of your character. Optionally the number of
turns that have passed, the energy cost of last action, the amount of readied ammunition
or the amount of gold pieces can be displayed in this area.
<li>A sequence of up to two characters describing your alignment (more
about this in the section on alignment).
</ul><p>

All lines between these two screen parts are used to display the map of the
current dungeon level or wilderness area (as far as you have explored it).
Specific characters are used to represent items, monsters, locations, and
other stuff.<p>

<h4 id="O32">The ADOM Deluxe Main Screen</h4>
The ADOM Deluxe main screen uses a graphical head up display (HUD) at the
top, a command icon system to the right and a message area at the bottom
left to display all important information. Additionally a mini-map is
displayed in various locations.<p>

You can use the mouse to hover over most of those areas. A tooltip will
show up if the element is clickable. The tooltip will show:<p>
<ul>
<li>detail information about the content of the element underneath the mouse cursor
<li>click hints pointing towards the effects of left- or right-clicking on the given element
</ul><p>

Noe that you also can hover over map positions. After a brief moment a
tooltip will be displayed giving detail information about the content of
the tile underneath (e.g. item, monster, tile and feature information). If
a monster is located beneath the mouse cursor you can click on the monster
icon in the tooltip to call upon the monster memory of your player
character (see the explanations in the section below).<p>

The HUD contains the following elements from left to right (and if you
can't see all of them you either should increase the size of your ADOM game
window or your screen resolution &ndash; the HUD works best with a resolution of
at least 1900 pixels horizontically):<p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the character
<li>The experience level of the character. A bar underneath the level shows
  your progress to advancing to the next level based on the number of
  experience points you have collected so far.
<li>The hit points (life energy) of your character.
<li>The power points (magical energy) of your character.
<li>DV: The defensive value of your character. And stacked underneath it&hellip;
<li>PV: The protection value of your character.
<li>St: The strength score of your character.
<li>Le: The learning score of your character.
<li>Wi: The willpower score of your character.
<li>Dx: The dexterity score of your character.
<li>To: The toughness score of your character.
<li>Ch: The charisma score of your character.
<li>Ap: The appearance score of your character.
<li>Ma: The mana score of your character.
<li>Pe: The perception score of your character.
<li>A letter shortcut for the current dungeon followed (usually) by the
number of the current dungeon level. And stacked underneath it&hellip;
<li>A sequence of up to two characters describing your alignment (more about
this in the section on alignment).
<li>The speed value of your character. Other values can be displayed here
(see the section on the 'Dynamic Display' for more details about this).
And stacked underneath it&hellip;
<li>The number of gold pieces currently carried by the player character.
</ul><p>

The icons on the right side are context-dependent and can be clicked
(always left-clicked and sometimes right-clicked). Make yourself familiar
with those icons (and observe changes as you move around) by closely
looking at the provided tooltips.<p>

The mini map gives an overview of the complete map (as depending on your
monitor resolution only a part of the full map is shown). You can click on
the mini map in order to navigate to currently invisible areas.<p>

Note that the whole map areas is clickable:<p>
<ul>
<li>Left-clicking on a location usually will move your character to that location.
<li>Left-clicking on a monster usually will attack that monster (either with a missile attack or in melee).
<li>Right-clicking on locations will open a context menu with all relevant options.
</ul><p>

Sometimes special icons and quick hints will be displayed in the upper
right corner. Special icons point towards hunger, poisoning and other
effects (and some of them are clickable, too, e.g. to consume food when
hungry).<p>

Finally take note of the mouse cursor: it changes in order to hint at the
left-click activity that will be executed when clicking on a specific
locations.<p>

<h3 id="O4">Quick Hints</h3>
Quick hints point towards special commands (and the keys to be entered to
activate them) which might be helpful in the current context. If you
dislike the quick hints you can disable them by pressing <tt>=</tt> and setting
the 'Quick_Hint_Limit' to zero).<p>

In ASCII mode quick hints are displayed as far away from the PC as possible
(in order to not obscure the map). In tiled mode they always are displayed
in the top right corner.<p>

Note that quick hints also disappear after playing for a while: when a
command has been activated 10 or more times with the key combination shown
by a quick hint, said quick hint no longer is available (as ADOM assumes
that you have memorized the given command). You can configure the number of
activations required by the 'Quick_Hint_Limit' as explained at the start of
this section.<p>

<h3 id="O5">The Display</h3>
<h4 id="O51">The ASCII Display</h4>
During game play everything you encounter is represented by certain symbols
on the map. Symbols are simple colored characters. Some symbols have more
than one meaning. This section explains the various symbols and their
potential meanings.<p>

Monsters are grouped into specific categories to make it easier to
distinguish them. The following scheme is used (with some

</table><p>

<h4 id="O52">The Tiled Display</h4>
The graphical tile display uses beautiful images to represent the map, all
monsters, items and features. Take care to notice special messages for
small icons on the ground!<p>

<h3 id="O6">The Monster Memory</h3>
One of the utilities provided by ADOM is the so-called monster memory. This
utility helps the player to memorize useful monster data, like monster DV
and PV, average hit points, number of attacks, average damage, and special
powers. The monster memory can be invoked in two ways: either you <tt>l</tt>ook
around and demand more information upon looking at a monster or you invoke
the <tt>&</tt> command and enter the name of a specific monster race (e. g.
'goblin' or 'white baby dragon'). If you have encountered the monster
before, you will receive information based upon your observations. This can
be as little as the physical description to as much as complete data about
the combat stats and powers of a monster.<p>

It is important to note that the monster memory takes into account the
abilities of your character. Based upon his Learning score, his Perception
score and some skills, it is more or less likely that the character will
learn something from his observations. This also means that your character
might mistake powers for something else. If a monster resists a fireball
due to its innate magic resistance the character still will believe that
the monster is immune to fire (just to name on example). Only later
experiences will remedy this observation.<p>

Additionally, the monster memory is not persistent. Between two games (that
is: from one character to the next) it will get erased. This is so
(compared to other games, which keep such a memory) because monsters in
ADOM are pretty dynamic. They have varying levels and can gain experience
like the PC. This effectively means that a monster can be very different
between two games. Since observations thus are very subjective, it would be
pretty misleading to keep such data between two games. It is my firm belief
that the monster memory should serve to mirror the observations of the
actual character and not those of the player. If you want to have a hint
through, use some sheets of paper and a pen (or pencil).<p>

<h3 id="O7">The Player Character Screen</h3>
ADOM provides a screen with most of the important statistics you might want
to know about your PC. Usually (as per default command set) this screen is
invoked by pressing <tt>@</tt>. The PC screen is divided into several parts
dedicated to certain aspects of the PC.<p>

The upper left half of the screen is dedicated to the attribute scores of
your PC. It lists all the attribute names in the first column (in yellow,
if not yet maxed out or in brown if maxed out in the natural way), followed
by the current unmodified attribute score. The next column lists the
natural maximums for the attribute scores. They can be raised by long and
hard training, but usually only magic will be of quick help when trying to
pass these limits. (See the section on attributes for more details.) The
next column displays temporary attribute bonuses (e.g. from certain
potions), followed by a column listing special bonuses (e.g. due to magical
items). The last column shows the total score for each attribute. If your
attribute score is raised, it will be displayed in green; if it's lowered
by some means, it will be displayed in red; if it's equal to the maximum
score possible, it will be displayed in brown. In all other cases yellow is
used.<p>

The upper right half of the screen contains a list of miscellaneous data.
First you'll see the current speed value. If you also enjoy a temporary
speed bonus, it will be displayed in square brackets. This is followed by a
verbal approximation of that value. Then the screen lists your current
financial status, potential debts, the name of your deity, and the elapsed
amount of game time. The next entries are concerned with your omens of
birth and star sign. First you'll see the number of the day on which you
were born in the Ancardian year followed by your star sign. Then you'll see
the <b>current</b> month in the game (both by number and by name). The next line
describes the <b>current</b> day in the game, both by its number in the current
month and by its absolute number in the current game year (so that you can
compare it to your birthday). Finally, the state of the moon (full, new,
waxing, waning) will be described. The last entry in that section displays
the age of your character.<p>

In the middle of the screen you'll see the encumbrance data for your PC. In
order, you'll see the current encumbrance, the minimum encumbrance to be
considered burdened and the respective minimum levels for being considered
strained and very strained.<p>

Below this, you'll see the data for melee combat, kicking, and missile
combat.<p>

<h3 id="O8">Standard Commands</h3>
During game play, commands are issued by pressing one or more keys.
Whenever you find a description like <tt>Ctrl+x</tt> you are expected to press the
Control-key and the key <tt>x</tt> at the same time to invoke the corresponding
command. The same holds true for the <tt>Alt+x</tt> notation although you have to
press Alt instead of Ctrl.<p>

The following default commands are normally available:<p>

<table border=1>

<h3 id="O9">Special Commands in ADOM Deluxe</h3>
The following extra commands are only available in ADOM Deluxe:<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th width="55px">Command<th>Meaning
<tr><td><tt>Ctrl+nx</tt><td>Activate NotEye expert configuration menu
<tr><td><tt>Ctrl+nvm</tt><td>Change music volume
<tr><td><tt>Ctrl+nvs</tt><td>Change sound volume
<tr><td><tt>Ctrl+nd</tt><td>Switch display mode
<tr><td><tt>Alt+Enter</tt><td>Switch fullscreen mode
<tr><td><tt>F10</tt><td>Toggle Tile/ASCII display
</table><p>

For details about the dynamic display see the end of this section.<p>

In the game you will encounter multiple screens containing tables, lists,
etc. Whenever you are given the choice to get out of one of those screens
by pressing the <tt>Z</tt> key, you can also press the space bar. The <tt>Z</tt> key is
always listed in the help lines because of historical reasons (and because
it's easier to display than the <tt> </tt> ;-)

It is possible to redefine the keybindings (see the appropriate section of
the manual for details).<p>

<h3 id="Oa">Movement</h3>
You can move into eight directions by pressing the respective number key
displayed in the following movement grid:
<pre>
                             7  8  9
                               \|/
                             4 -5- 6
                               /|\
                             1  2  3
</pre>
To attack a monster, simply try to move into the field the monster is
standing on. This will result in a melee attack.<p>

If you opt for faster movement you can activate the so-called 'walk-mode'
by pressing <tt>w</tt> followed by a direction key. This will make your character
walk into the chosen direction until he meets something of interest.
Movement will cease as soon as one of the following things happens:<p>
<ul>
<li>Your direction of choice is blocked.
<li>A monster appears in your immediate vicinity.
<li>Items are lying at your current position.
<li>Something special (e.g. a stairway) is located at your current position.
<li>A move will bring you into the immediate vicinity of a monster.
<li>You are stunned, confused or blinded.
<li>Your hunger status changes.
<li>You are bleeding, sick or poisoned.
</ul><p>

Generally, activating 'walk-mode' is a good way to cover long distances
which have been explored before. To make full use of the vast array of
available tactical options, you should not use 'walk-mode' when exploring
unknown locations.<p>

Walk-mode also allows the character to wait in place (e.g. to regenerate
lost hit points or power points). Just press <tt>w</tt> for walk-mode and the <tt>5</tt>
for waiting in place. Walk-mode will abort if a monster enters your
immediate vicinity, your equipment weight or your hunger level changes or
50 turns have gone by.<p>

If you are using the numeric keypad remember to press <tt>NUM LOCK</tt>.<p>

<h3 id="Ob">Speed</h3>
Actions in real life rarely are synchronous. Beings rather act
individually, move with different speed and are either slower or faster
than others. ADOM simulates this by using a 'speed system'. The core notion
of this system is that every character and monster has to collect a certain
amount of energy to be able to act. Some beings are able to gather this
energy faster and thus can act at higher speed, others gain this energy
more slowly and thus act in a slower way.<p>

To be able to act once in ADOM your character needs to accumulate at least
1000 energy points. Every acting being has a 'speed value' and a current
energy rating. ADOM divides each player turn into a number of segments. In
each segment every being on the current level adds its speed value to its
current energy. Each being that passes the '1000 energy minimum' with its
current energy value is allowed to act. Afterwards the current energy
rating is reduced by 1000 (in most cases).<p>

All Player Characters start with a basic speed value of 100 which basically
means that they can act once every 10 segments. This rating can be modified
by class (monks and beastfighters get faster with more experience),
dexterity (a score of 17 or higher can be helpful), encumbrance level (the
more you are encumbered the slower you get), alcohol level (being drunk is
not a good idea in all cases), satiation level (a full stomach makes you
move slower&hellip; starving doesn't help either), your Athletics skill, and
special items. Being born under the sign of the Raven also helps.<p>

Your energy can never be lower than 1 (although this spells certain doom)
and is not limited by any value. The only limit is that you can act only
once per segment (even speed scores of 2000+ can't help in this respect&hellip;
although they are impossible to attain in any case).<p>

Most monsters also have a base speed value of 100, although there are
exceptions. Be prepared to face changing speed monstrosities occasionally.<p>

Finally you need to understand that some items don't increase your overall
speed score but might limit the energy costs for certain actions (e.g.
seven league boots could require you to expend but 500 energy points to be
able to move &ndash; thus you could move faster, but all other actions would be
carried out at normal speed). This is also true for weapon skills which are
able to reduce the amount of energy required to stage an attack (see the
section on weapon skills for details).<p>

SPECIAL NOTE: If you are setting your tactics level to 'coward' and then
simply move around without attacking anything, such a move only costs 800
energy points <b>if</b> your hit points are reduced to one-third their starting
value or below (panic does that to you &ndash; and since ADOM basically is a
heroic game we'll ignore other wound effects). Remember this when you try
to run away!<p>

<h3 id="Oc">The Dynamic Display</h3>
The dynamic display is used to present detailed information about the
actions of the player. It either can display one of the following pieces of
information:<p>
<ul>
<li>the current number of moves executed by the player (an internal game counter)
<li>the current speed value of the PC
<li>the energy cost of the last action executed by the PC
<li>the number of gold pieces carried by the PC or
<li>the remaining number of missiles in the quiver of the PC
</ul><p>

By default the current speed value is displayed.<p>

Note that the 'energy cost for the last action' display option does not
necessarily show the expected value for energy costs below 1000. This is so
because ADOM's internal rating system for action costs relies on relative
measurements (e.g. if your potion of speed results in an 800 energy point
cost for movement and due to your class you also would be able to move for
800 energy points, this is scaled to a cost of 100000 / {100 + [(100000 /
800) - 100] * 2} = 666 energy points). If you don't understand the formula,
simply look at the source code. ;-) Not understanding it is <b>not</b> a sign of
being stupid ;-))<p>

<h3 id="Od">Dice</h3>
Roleplaying games mostly use dice to generate random events. Paper games
rely on several kinds of dice &ndash; most often 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and
20-sided dice are used. Computers are not limited by arbitrary die forms
and thus enjoy the freedom to use any kind of dice imaginable as a random
number generator.<p>

Roleplayers use an abbreviated way of describing the number of dice to be
rolled to generate a random number. Basically a certain number of dice is
rolled, all the face values are added and maybe a modifier is added or
subtracted to generate a total. This is normally abbreviated as
<pre>
                        {x}d{y}+{z}
</pre>
and means to roll {x} dice with {y} faces and finally to add the value {z}.
{z} can be positive or negative. If {z} is not mentioned, it is assumed to
be zero.<p>

EXAMPLES: 1d20 means to roll one 20-sided die to generate a number between
1 and 20. 2d6 means to roll two 6-sided dice to generate a number between 2
and 12. 4d4+3 means to roll four 4-sided dice and finally add 3 to generate
a number between 7 and 19. 3d13-9 means to roll three 13-sided dice and
subtract 9 to generate a number between -6 and 30.<p>

<h3 id="Oe">The Inventory &amp; Item Descriptions</h3>
<h4 id="Oe1">The Inventory</h4>
Every PC normally carries quite a number of items &ndash; some of them belong to
the initial equipment, others are found during the adventure.<p>

All items worn or equipped are displayed upon pressing the <tt>i</tt> key. If you
want to change your equipment (either by wearing an additional item or by
removing an item currently used) you simply need to press the letter
preceding the body part in question. If an item was equipped, it will
automatically be removed. If no item was used you will automatically be
shown a list with items which might be useful on that body part.<p>

Items normally have to be identified by some means to get more than just
some general information. Some items are identified by using them (e.g.
weapons and armor), others have to be identified by magical means. When
identified, every item might list a number of values which further describe
the powers of the item.<p>

Armor must be worn to have any effect. Weapons must be wielded to have any
effect. Rings, bracers and necklaces must be worn to be useful.<p>

Items are generally rated as uncursed, cursed or blessed. Cursed items
cannot be removed when worn and mostly do not function with full effect.
They also are susceptible to damage more often. Blessed items are of very
high quality and might exert some additional powers. They are more
difficult to damage. Uncursed items represent average items.<p>

Items also might be broken or rusty. There might be means available to
repair or improve such items&hellip; try to find out about this for yourself.<p>

In the following section, items are listed by category with all possible
modifiers. The following abbreviations are used to describe the modifiers:<p>
<ul>
<li>CHA - Number of charges remaining
<li>DAM - Damage dice (given in the dice notation explained above)
<li>DVM - DV modifier
<li>MDM - Missile damage modifier
<li>MEM - Melee attack modifier
<li>MIM - Missile attack modifier
<li>PVM - PV modifier
<li>ATM - Modifier to a specific attribute
</ul><p>

The following item descriptions are available. First the item type is
listed, then the possible modifiers follow. Not all modifiers always
appear, this depends on the specific item. The kind of visible modifiers
can be determined by the type of brackets surrounding them:<p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;bracers&gt; [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;shield&gt; (MEM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;armor&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;gauntlets&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;cloak&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;girdle&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;helmet&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;boots&gt; (MEM, MIM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;wand&gt; (CHA)
<li>&lt;melee weapon&gt; (MEM, DAM) [DVM, PVM]
<li>&lt;missile weapon&gt; (MIM, MDM)
<li>&lt;missile&gt; (MIM, DAM)
</ul><p>

Any item (in theory) can be followed by {ATM}, which means that the item in
question grants the specified bonus to the mentioned attribute. Any weapon
can be followed by (p), which means that the item is poisoned.

Finally, the number of charges for wands will only be visible if you zapped
that specific wand successfully or identified that specific wand. In other
words: if you identify 'tin wands' as 'wands of magic missiles', you still
won't know the number of charges of a newly found 'wand of magic missiles'
(although it will be correctly identified in all other respects).<p>

<h4 id="Oe2">Working with the Backpack</h4>
Beside those items you carry directly on your body (which can be viewed by
pressing <tt>i</tt>), you also have a backpack which might contain large numbers
of items (directly viewable by pressing <tt>I</tt>). At times you need to retrieve
an item from that backpack and this can be a very tiring process if you are
carrying a large number of items. Therefore ADOM contains a mechanism to
filter the list of items in the backpack, so that only certain item types
are displayed and it's easier to find the item you are looking for.

Whenever it is possible to apply a filter to the items in your backpack,
the last line of the screen will display the current filter and the
possible commands to select a certain item type. In all cases (except for
<tt>#</tt> &ndash; which stands for all items), you can select a certain category of
items by pressing the symbol which usually represents those items. The
following keys are used to filter the items in the backpack:<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Key  <th>Meaning
<tr><td><tt>[</tt><td>wearable items [1]
<tr><td><tt>'</tt><td>necklaces
<tr><td><tt>,</tt><td>bracers [2]
<tr><td><tt>(</tt><td>melee weapons
<tr><td><tt>}</tt><td>missile weapons
<tr><td><tt>/</tt><td>missiles
<tr><td><tt>]</tt><td>tools
<tr><td><tt>{</tt><td>musical instruments
<tr><td><tt>=</tt><td>rings
<tr><td><tt>\</tt><td>wands
<tr><td><tt>!</tt><td>potions
<tr><td><tt>?</tt><td>scrolls
<tr><td><tt>"</tt><td>books
<tr><td><tt>%</tt><td>food
<tr><td><tt>$</tt><td>gold
<tr><td><tt>*</tt><td>gems
<tr><td><tt>#</tt><td>all items
</table><p>
[1] Helmets, armor, gauntlets, cloaks, girdles, boots.<p>
[2] This is an exception to the 'image rule' since some
systems wait for a second key to be pressed after the <tt>~</tt> used for
bracers and this would make this feature somewhat tiresome to use).<p>

<h3 id="Of">Beasts of Burden</h3>
While many players seem to enjoy carrying around heaps of stuff, this is
not really recommended. If you carry a lot of stuff, you'll get hungry
sooner. This in turn means that you probably will have to carry more food,
which can get damaged and further burdens you. ADOM uses several burden
levels (from burdened to strained, to very strained and to overburdened) to
mirror this fact. Each burden level comes with a growing need for food.
Take care!<p>

<h3 id="Og">Wishing</h3>
In ADOM you might encounter magical wishes. Wishes are a powerful form of
magic which allows a variety of effects.<p>

ADOM supports two types of wishes. You can wish for abstract things and
concepts like friends, money, wealth, strength, health, and other things.<p>

You can also wish for items. Such wishes can be very useful, since ADOM
features many powerful and rare items. If you do not want to wait for a
certain item, just wish for it as soon as you receive a free wish. Since
wishes are powerful but not very precise magic, you can only wish for very
general items. For example, it's not possible to wish for 6 blessed long
swords (+6, 1d8+6), but you would rather have to wish for long swords or
mithril plate mails. If your wish is not formulated precisely you might get
something other than what you are expecting &ndash; so be careful!<p>

<h3 id="Oh">Saving the Game</h3>
To save a game in progress you just have to press the <tt>S</tt> key and answer
the following question with a <tt>y</tt>. The game will be saved and you can
load it later to continue your game. You should make sure that you have
enough free space on your disk before saving the game as ADOM will
otherwise crash. You need about 30000 bytes plus 12000 bytes per level that
you have explored. Levels with lots of monsters or items need more space.
Generally three free megabytes should be enough for any one game (no matter
how deep you venture). Note that the game will quit upon saving. Note also
that your save file will be deleted if your character dies. This is a
special feature of all roguelike games. You are expected to win without
ever dying.<p>

To load a saved game, just start ADOM and type <tt>l</tt> on the option screen.
If you choose that option a tiny menu will display the available games to
be restored (if there are any). Please note that this menu only displays a
maximum of 20 saved games (without telling you that there might be
additional saved games). This should be sufficient for most purposes.
Depending on your screen resolution even less games might be shown (e.g. 16
under DOS).<p>
