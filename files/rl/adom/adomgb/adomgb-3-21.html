<h3>Mana Temple</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-21-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Mana Temple is found on its own level, MT, the last level of the UL, the Unreal Cave system. The UL is a side branch off the main CoC
at D: 46 or D: 47. The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation does not
work on this level. The walls of the Mana Temple itself are undiggable. It must be entered through the single tile room at the
southwest of the Temple. Traps are completely surrounding the Temple. Ceiling traps replace teleportation traps in the Mana Temple.
The chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is disturbed and moves) is found in the center.
The standard warning about standing on altars applies &ndash; many of the monsters are capable of speech and will sacrifice the PC.
The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an Ultra ending cannot convert them
early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.<p>

To attack the temple, the PC must dig into the sigle tile room in the south of the temple,
then she must travel through the trap-filled tunnel around the temple. During this, the magebane eyes and
magedoom eyes will be draining the power points of the PC. Classes which are dependent on power points are well advised to
bring along blessed scrolls of power. If possible, a wand of trap detection should be saved for the Mana Temple. This is a much
faster way of detecting the traps than using the Detect Traps skill, especially when combined with the Farsight spell or a necklace of
the eye. The faster this tunnel is traversed, the less time the eyes have to drain the PP. The Mana Temple ranks with
the nastiest places in the game. Many players do not enter the temple itself, instead staying in the corridor. Using this
technique, the monsters can be fought one at a time. Even so, the chaos wizards are summoners, so the PC can still be surrounded
by summoned monsters in the corridor. The objective using this method is to wait for Nuurag-Vaarn to exit the temple, kill him,
collect the Orb and flee.<p>

<h4 id="3l2">3.21.2 Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage <tt>@</tt></h4>

Nuurag-Vaarn is a difficult opponent, to say the least. He has a corrupting melee attack. He is very fond of casting spells,
especially Death Ray, Darkness, and Invisibility. Entering the Mana Temple without a means of death ray resistance is virtual suicide.
Since the Ancient Mummy Wrapping provides both death ray resistance and the See invisible intrinsic, it is a logical armor choice while
in the Mana Temple. Nuurag-Vaarn is also very good at confusing the PC, cursing, and is an attribute drainer.
In fact he has access to all spells available to monsters except healing. He is immune to elemental attacks other than acid. He is
vulnerable to humanoid slaying ammo; this is a good way to attack him if the PC can maintain a clear shot at him through all the
monsters, summoned and otherwise, in the temple.<p>

To summarize the prerequisites needed to fight Nuurag-Vaarn:<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>death ray resistance &ndash; essential
<li>confusion resistance &ndash; essential
<li>light source &ndash; essential
<li>See invisible intrinsic &ndash; recommended
<li>fire, cold, lightning resistance &ndash; recommended
<li>humanoid slaying ammo &ndash; recommended
</ol><p>

<h4 id="3l3">3.21.3 Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana <tt>]</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item612.png" alt="cooem" align="left">
Nuurag-Vaarn holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana. Whilst worn in the tool slot, it raises
Mana by 10. When <tt>U</tt>sed the orb replenishes PP, increases Mana by 3, and increases maximum PP by 10
(independent of Mana); though doing so adds 5000 corruption points (2500 with Elemental Gauntlets equipped).
Note that while it can also be used as a melee or missile weapon, wielding it as such won't confer the Mana bonus.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
---------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana {Ma+10} --------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d16+3 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +10.

(full PP, +10 max PP, +3 Mana, heavy corruption when <tt>U</tt>sed)
