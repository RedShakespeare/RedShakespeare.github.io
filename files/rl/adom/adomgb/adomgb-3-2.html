<h3>Arena</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-2-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Arena level is found on D: 3-5. It can be immediately recognized by repeated messages saying "You hear the ecstatic cries of a large crowd!"
As might be expected at a huge attraction like the Arena, there are vendors selling food on this level. It is home to several ratling traders,
ratling rebel, the dwarf Nak An'Dwar, and Dak, the arena master.<p>

The Arena itself is for combat practice, with the rewards for a successful fight being gold pieces. The rewards get larger as the PC wins more fights. A PC should not fight
more than 19 times in the Arena before descending to deeper levels of the CoC. This is because she will encounter an NPC later (see <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#3531">3.5.3.1</a>)
who assigns a quest to win the 20th Arena fight.<p>

<span class="credit">Credit Timofei Shatrov.</span> 
There are five possible opponents in each fight, although some of them are duplicates. Note that all Arena opponents have their HP increased by 5*PC's Level, but their other stats
are unchanged, so it just takes a little longer to kill them. The table below shows the possible opponents, with cats in bold capitals and duplicates in parentheses:<p>

<h4 id="322">3.2.2 20th Arena opponent</h4>
The 20th fight will be against a named former champion, who will feature +40 Speed. These opponents are more difficult than the standard Arena opponents. There are four possibilities:<p>

<img src="tiles/125.png" alt="Li-Hon-Kay">
<img src="tiles/83.png" alt="Spardakius">
<img src="tiles/34.png" alt="Ripclaw">
<img src="tiles/31.png" alt="Bonk"><br>
<table border=1><caption>Possible 20th arena opponent</caption>
<tr><th>Opponent   <th>Race       <th>ASCII     <th>Remarks
<tr><td>Li-Hon-Kay <td>ogre magus <td><tt>O</tt><td>uses Invisibility and Frost Bolt, regenerates; alternate name Li-Han-Kay
<tr><td>Spardakius <td>minotaur   <td><tt>M</tt><td>brute force
<tr><td>Ripclaw    <td>troll      <td><tt>T</tt><td>brute force
<tr><td>Bonk       <td>hill giant <td><tt>H</tt><td>brute force
</table><p>

Li-Hon-Kay (2/5 chance to appear) can be particularly annoying and dangerous. He regenerates health, casts invisibility, and attacks with frost bolts. PCs without cold 
resistance and the ability to see invisible will probably not survive a fight with Li-Hon-Kay.
Fortunately, cold immunity and the ability to see invisible are granted by the Ancient Mummy Wrapping, an artifact armor held by Rehetep, the mummy lord (section
<a href="adomgb-2-9.html#2921">2.9.2.1</a>). Players who want to be conservative and maximize the chances of survival in the 20th
Arena fight will tackle the Pyramid first. Note also that although ogre magi are somewhat resistant to confusion, if one is successfully confused using Mindcraft,
they are unable to become invisible. This works for Li-Hon-Kay as well as ordinary ogre magi. The other 20th fight Arena opponents will fall to offensive magic or simple
brute force bashing.<p>

<h4 id="3221">3.2.2.1 Golden gladius "Death's Sting" <tt>(</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item252.png" alt="ds" align="left">
The reward for winning the 20th Arena fight is an artifact sword, the Golden Gladius. It's needed to get Backstabbing, Two weapon combat, and especially the much desired Tactics
skill from Bart, or it can be used for the Demented Ratling in Dwarftown.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
------- golden gladius "Death's Sting" (+2, 2d5+2) [+3, +3] (+7 spd) -------

Weight: 30s

When worn it modifies DV by +3 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 2d5+2 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of damage.

It modifies your speed by +7.
</pre></table><p>

<h4 id="323">3.2.3 After the 20th fight</h4>
There are a limited number of fights available after the 20th fight, but beware: anything can be generated as an opponent in such fights. It is quite possible to be
faced with an emperor lich or ancient karmic dragon. The monetary rewards for such fights are about 1000 gold pieces each, not worth it if the PC has to face a difficult
opponent. Furthermore, the experience gains from these fights are dependent on the experience level of the PC. Those who have difficulty gaining experience (Trolls,
Raven-born Athletic Monks, etc.) should leave these fights for when they are at a high experience level.<p>

<h4 id="324">3.2.4 Dak, the arena master <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/127.png" alt="Dak, the arena master" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 22, PV: 12, Hits: 108, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+12, Speed: 100.</table>
Dak provides access to the Arena. Note that he will not admit invisible PCs to the Arena, whether or not they have fought in the Arena
before. He responds with "Sorry, we've hired more than enough invisible stalkers. Look for a job elsewhere or come back when some of yer pals are used up."
Player with permanent invisibility obtained from a pool or invisible stalker corpse can only enter the Arena under the influence
of a potion of visibility <big>or wearing regular mummy wrapping</big>. For this reason it may be wise to at least finish 19 arena fights, 
if not become a champion altogether, before the PC drinks from any pools. If the PC teleports out of the Arena without killing the opponent and returns to Dak, he tries to
stun, then confuse, then paralyze the PC before teleporting them back into the Arena.<p>

Note that it is possible to unintentionally cause Dak to become hostile during an arena fight, eg. if he is hit by a ball spell that reaches outside the front entrance of the Arena.
Doing so will end the fight after a certain amount of turns, and cause the Arena Master to attack without giving a reward for the completed fight (and, of course, forfeit the possibility
of any future fights and rewards).<p>

Also, if you create a closed door on the tile the PC is teleported to after winning a fight, it will be opened and the message "You hear a short clapping sound." is displayed upon winning
again. This is the only way to teleport on top of a door in ADOM, and according to the old bug tracker, said effect was intentionally coded for this sole possibility.<p>

<h4 id="325">3.2.5 Ratling traders <tt>r</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/128.png" alt="ratling trader" align="left"><img src="tiles/128f.png" alt="female ratling trader" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 10, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</table>
There are several ratling traders on the Arena level who sell food. The best food source is cooked lizards, which weigh only 3 stones each and are very nutritious. Also
available are fried bats, which are less nutritious, but still acceptable. It is not worth buying rat tails, fat worms, and cooked roaches. They have very low nutrition value, even
for Trolls, who can eat almost anything. See <a href="adomgb-app-G.html">Appendix G</a> for details.<p>

Ratling traders typically have more stock if their stock is uncursed or cursed &ndash; blessed stock seems to number at the low end of the range.
In contrast to shops, which restock dependent on total game time passed, the ratling traders seem to restock dependent on game passed on the Arena level only. Thus a PC
may go off adventuring for many days, return to the Arena and find no new food available. Wait or run around on the level for a while and the traders should eventually restock.<p>

It is worthwhile to <tt>n</tt>ame the ratling traders according to the wares they sell. This prevents aimless searching for the traders who sell worthwhile food. They can also be
slowed down with the Slow Monster spell, which will not turn them hostile.<p>

<h4 id="326">3.2.6 Ratling Rebel <tt>r</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/129f.png" alt="ratling rebel" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 19, PV: 4, Hits: 18, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</table>
The Ratling Rebel provides scrolls denouncing arena fights. He seems to have an infinite number of these scrolls, as it is possible to get several hundred of them by repeatedly <tt>C</tt>hatting.
They can be sold for small amount of cash, used for training Literacy, cleared with a potion of water for use with a magical writing set, or polymorphed with blessed potion of exchange or potion
of raw chaos to turn them into a more useful scroll. Note there is no danger of explosion, as the pamphlets are never generated randomly. The Ratling Rebel will attack PCs wearing furs when
chatted with. Another way to make him hostile is to <tt>g</tt>ive him back his pamphlet. He rewards PCs that kill Dak the Arena Master with a scroll of peace, and alignment shift towards N=.
After obtaining the scroll of peace from him, he will not give pamphlets anymore. Note that 'he' might also be generated female.<p>

<h4 id="327">3.2.7 Cats in the Arena <tt>f</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/7.png" alt="wild cat" align="left">
<img src="tiles/133.png" alt="cave lion" align="left">
<img src="tiles/35.png" alt="cave tiger" align="left">
Cats in the Arena are a special problem. If the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat, directly killing cats must be avoided (section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a>).
There are several ways to deal with cats in the Arena. Teleportation is one, from a wand or spell. Potions of exchange thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster. A cat can
be led over a trap until it is killed, teleported or turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos. However, if the PC sets off a trap which kills a cat, she is charged with
killing the cat. For this reason, as well as general tactical information, it is useful to know the layout of traps in the Arena when they are created. A map showing the traps
produced when the Arena is generated on D: 3 is shown below:<p>
<pre>
  ###############.###############
  #0123456789AB0###456789AB01234#
  #123456789AB0123456789AB012345#
  #23456789AB0123456789AB0123456#
  #3456789AB0123456789AB01234567#
  ###############################

    0 - fireball      6 - arrow
    1 - pit           7 - acid
    2 - light         8 - pit (vipers)
    3 - corruption    9 - spear
    4 - stone block   A - teleport
    5 - alarm         B - water
</pre><p>

The pattern shifts, but otherwise remains the same, and can therefore be worked out by creating a single trap, when the Arena is generated on other levels.<p>

<small>Trap table has been removed in R+, all traps are random.</small><p>

<div class="newb">
<h4 id="328">3.2.8 Nak An'Dwar, the dwarven gladiator <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/439.png" alt="dwarven gladiator" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 9, Hits: 210, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d8+8, Speed: 120.</table>
Nak An'Dwar possesses an Antediluvian Dwarven Map Fragment, and will give it to non-Orc and non-Troll PCs who <tt>C</tt>hat to him with Rolf's Companion and Rolf's Savior equipped.
He drops the fragment when killed, in addition to a mithril battle axe. He drops them also after being turned into a creature of chaos. He has a penetrating melee attack and is immune to
confusion.<p>
