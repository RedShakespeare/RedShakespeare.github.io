<h2 id="B">Generating the Player Character</h2>
To be able to fight Chaos, you will have to create a fictional character,
often called the player character (or PC). This character will be chosen
from one of the intelligent races of Ancardia, will undergo long and hard
hours of training to learn a profession and many skills enhancing his
chance to defeat evil and finally save the world.<p>

All these concepts are explained in detail in the sections below.<p>

Specifically the following choices will have to be made to create a new
player character (but note that in some easier game modes the game might
choose for you in some cases):<p>
<ul>
<li>Star Sign (see the horoscope of Ancardia)
<li>Gender
<li>Race
<li>Profession
<li>Talents
</ul><p>

Additionally various other items will be derived from your choices above:<p>
<ul>
<li>Attributes
<li>Alignment
<li>Skills
<li>Spells
<li>Initial Equipment
</ul><p>
