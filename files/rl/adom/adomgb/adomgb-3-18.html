<h3>Earth Temple</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-18-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Earth Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 42-46. The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Some of the walls in the Earth Temple are
undiggable, but there is a way into every room by digging &ndash; it may take some experimentation to find it. There are many
traps and secret passages in the temple. In the center of the temple, there is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian
is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The standard warning about standing on altars applies &ndash; the stone grues (and
possibly other monsters) found on this level are capable of speech and will sacrifice the PC. The elemental altars can only be converted by
champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an Ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the
Medal of Chaos.<p>

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. All of the monsters here with the exception of stone golems
and chaos servants are able to travel through stone, so in practice the PC will probably be attacked before penetrating the walls of the temple.
Stone snakes are poisonous, stone grues have a corrupting melee attack and earth elementals throw rocks, apparently using slings which are often
left behind when they are killed. Earth elementals have many hitpoints and regenerate. Exact statistics for earth elementals and stone grues
are not available from a blessed stethoscope &ndash; the game responds that the monster "rather seems to be a piece of furniture." The monster memory
states that earth elementals have about 210 hitpoints, stone grues about 235 hitpoints. They both have a PV of 40, so use a powerful melee
attack or they will take forever to kill. All of these monsters will fall to brute force or magic.<p>

<h4 id="3i2">3.18.2 Ancient Stone Beast <tt>F</tt></h4>

Attacking the Ancient Stone Beast may seem like attacking a wall of granite. Not fast, not overwhelming PV, but it can take a formidable amount
of bashing to bring down this creature. Not helping matters is the fact that it regenerates wounds and has a corrupting melee attack. It is vulnerable
to demon slayers.<p>

<h4 id="3i3">3.18.3 Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth <tt>]</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item305.png" alt="cooee" align="left">
The Ancient Stone Beast holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth. Whilst worn in the tool slot, it raises
Toughness by 10. When <tt>U</tt>sed the orb replicates the Earthquake spell; though doing so adds 300 corruption points
(150 with Elemental Gauntlets equipped). Note that while it can also be used as a melee or missile
weapon, wielding it as such won't confer the Tougness bonus.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
--------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} --------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 3d9+3 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +10.

(Earthquake + corruption when <tt>U</tt>sed)
