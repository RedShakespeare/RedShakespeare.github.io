<h2 id="F">Alignment</h2>
One very important characteristic of the persona you are creating is
his alignment. ADOM depicts the epic struggle between Law and Chaos
and your character needs to take sides! Either your PC will side
with Law and bring order to the multiverse or your PC will side with
the ever-changing forces of Chaos and bring chaos, change and upheaval
to the world. There even might be a third way, but will your PC find
out how to proceed on this path?<p>

Generally, alignments represent the basic moral ideas and beliefs of
a character. A lawful character believes in law, order, the welfare
of the whole community, tradition, peace and happiness. Chaotic
characters enjoy change, are creative but also are quite selfish and
generally are an unorganized lot. Some of the more extreme chaotic
beings are downright evil, many extreme chaotics are quite mad.
Lastly, there are neutral beings who apply the best or worst
principles of both sides to make up their basic belief system.<p>

All in all, the system is not as "black and white" as it might seem.
There are many shades. Nonetheless, the basic axis looks like this:<p>
<pre>
     Chaos <-----------------> Neutrality <-----------------> Law
</pre>
In ADOM every being has an alignment. Your PC's initial alignment
depends on his race: High Elves, Dwarves and Hurthlings are lawful
initially, while Trolls, Orcs and Dark Elves are chaotic. All other
races are initially neutral. Choosing to be a necromancer also alters
your alignment towards Chaos. If your character starts out as a Druid,
he will always be neutral.<p>

In ADOM these alignments are divided into seven categories. A
shortcut describing the current category your PC belongs to will
always be listed on the screen to represent your PC's current
position. The following five symbols are possible:<p>
<ul>
<li>L+ : The character is extremely lawful. He might be able to become a very powerful Champion of Law.
<li>L  : The character is lawful.
<li>N+ : The character has not yet chosen a side, but prefers to remain unaligned. Still, he has a minor tendency towards Law.
<li>N= : The character is as close to neutrality as possible for a mortal. He can become a Champion of Balance.
<li>N- : The character has not yet chosen a side, but prefers to remain unaligned. Still, he has a minor tendency towards Chaos.
<li>C  : The character is chaotic.
<li>C- : The character is extremely chaotic. He might be able to become a very mighty Champion of Chaos.
</ul><p>

There are also four "in-between" alignments which show your character's
tendencies. Generally, the alignment is still rated according to the
first letter of the alignment description (L for lawful, N for neutral
and C for chaotic). Nonetheless, these in-between alignments indicate
that a change to the alignment described by the second letter might be
impending due to your PC's actions. The following special alignment
descriptions are possible:<p>
<ul>
<li>LN : Lawful with tendencies towards Neutrality.
<li>NL : Neutral with tendencies towards Law.
<li>NC : Neutral with tendencies towards Chaos.
<li>CN : Chaotic with tendencies towards Neutrality.
</ul><p>

Thus the complete range of alignment order from Law to Chaos looks like this:<p>

<pre>
  L+ -- L -- LN --- NL -- N+ -- N= -- N- -- NC --- CN -- C -- C-
  L A W F U L            N E U T R A L             C H A O T I C
</pre>

Now the final question: what effect does alignment have upon the game?
Depending on alignment, a different deity is worshipped. Some
items might be more or less useful for your character depending on his
alignment. Other beings might react in a different manner depending on
alignment. There are lots of things that can happen&hellip; try to
find out for yourself.<p>

<h3 id="F1">The Gods</h3>
Besides the forces of Law and Chaos, the Gods of Ancardia are a ruling
force in the universe. There is a multitude of gods and each race has
at least three major gods they worship &ndash; one for each alignment.<p>

In the worlds of Ancardia the Gods are a tangible force. Their effects
can be seen through ancient artifacts they once created for their
worshipers and the miracles their priests perform. They also are known
to be fickle and dangerous at times&hellip; insult or annoy them and their
wrath will be upon you!<p>

Each character in ADOM worships (at least nominally) the deity of his
alignment. Throughout the game you have many chances to influence your
standing towards your god. You can increase your piety by sacrificing
to your god &ndash; but make sure that you are sacrificing at the right
altar! This will help you in dire situations, where you might be
able to pray for divine intervention and receive some help. But be
careful&hellip; if you annoy your deity too often, you might incur some
serious penalties. It's also said that various miracles can occur at
holy sites.<p>

Finally, great piety can bring you the highest honor: your god might
declare you to be a champion of his/her religion, endowing you with
great powers and the ability to use artifacts with less risk than
other mortals.<p>

Nonetheless, remaining in good standing is an impressive feat: you need
to sacrifice somewhat regularly lest your god becomes bored and
forgets you. The more powerful you become, the better your sacrifices
need to be and the more often you ask for help, the faster your god
will become annoyed with you.<p>

The gods of the various races enjoy some gifts particularly:<p>
<ul>
<li>Dark Elves <big>and Mist Elves</big>: magical wands and books
<li>Drakelings: musical instruments
<li>Gnomes: gems
<li>Dwarves: gold
<li>High Elves and Gray Elves: magical rings
<li>Humans: tools of all kind
<li>Hurthlings: cooked meals
<li>Orcs: melee weapons
<li><big>Ratlings: the ratling gods appreciate artifacts, thank you!</big>
<li>Trolls: rocks, the larger the better
</ul><p>

Such gifts are very welcome and will be of higher benefit to your
character's piety. On the other hand, gods also dislike certain
sacrifices&hellip; so be careful with your actions!<p>
