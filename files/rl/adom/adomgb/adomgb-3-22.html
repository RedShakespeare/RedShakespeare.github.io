<h3>D: 48 &ndash; Elemental Anomalies</h3>
Level 48 of the Caverns of Chaos contains special transforming/reversible staircase, and five elemental anomalies corresponding to the five Chaos Orbs. They are guarded by
four elemental grues <tt>x</tt> with the usual corrupting grue melee attack. The mana anomaly is not guarded by a grue, but rather a chaos wizard <tt>C</tt>. The idea here is
to <tt>U</tt>se each Chaos Orb while standing on the appropriate elemental anomaly. If done properly, it will reverse the staircase. A transcript of the results and some remarks follow.<p>

<i>Warning: following the procedures on this page is irreversible. The PC cannot return to the higher levels of the CoC. Have everything you will need with
you before proceeding.</i><p>

<h4 id="3m1">3.22.1 Mana anomaly &ndash; green underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/mana_o.png" alt="mana anomaly" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You face a strange small rift in the air leading into unknown dimensions of pure energy.
Do you want to drop the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana {Ma+10} into the rift? [y/N]
You drop the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana {Ma+10} into the strange rift.
For some seconds a strange silence fills the whole level.
Suddenly the rift disappears.
</pre></table><p>

Using the Mana Orb in this way causes the PC's power points to drop to zero and a loss of two points of the Mana attribute. For this reason, spellcasters
may want to do this anomaly first, to allow the maximum time for PP to regenerate. Blessed scrolls of power are very useful here.<p>

<h4 id="3m2">3.22.2 Earth anomaly &ndash; brown underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/earth_o.png" alt="earth anomaly" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You face a man-high stone column with a round opening in the center.
Do you want to put the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the hole? [y/N]
You fit the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the stone column.
For some seconds the whole level is shaking.
Suddenly the column disappears.
</pre></table><p>

The shaking of the level seems to imply some sort of minor earthquake, but the level takes no damage as a result.<p>

<h4 id="3m3">3.22.3 Water anomaly &ndash; blue underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/water_o.png" alt="water anomaly" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You face a shimmering pool of unknown depth.
Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into shimmering pool? [y/N]
You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into the shimmering pool.
For some seconds the air gets very humid on this level.
Suddenly the humidity dispenses and everything is normal once more.
</pre></table><p>

The humidity generated by this operation will damage anything vulnerable to water damage &ndash; be careful, have waterproof blankets, do not have unprotected
iron armor or weapons exposed.<p>

<h4 id="3m4">3.22.4 Air anomaly &ndash; light blue underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/air_o.png" alt="air anomaly" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You face a man-high whirlwind rising out of a hole in the ground.
Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the whirlwind? [y/N]
You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the whirlwind.
For some seconds a roaring wind soars through this level.
Suddenly everything is silent and the whirlwind disappears.
</pre></table><p>

This roaring wind seems to do no damage.<p>

<h4 id="3m5">3.22.5 Fire anomaly &ndash; red underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/fire_o.png" alt="fire anomaly" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You face a man-high bonfire.
Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the roaring bonfire? [y/N]
You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the bonfire.
For some seconds the whole level is filled with an immense heat. You resist the searing flames.
Suddenly the level cools down once more and the bonfire is gone.
</pre></table><p>

The fire anomaly is by far the most dangerous. It will damage anything vulnerable to fire. This includes any monsters that may be wandering the
level. That includes cats. It is very disappointing and frustrating to kill a cat in this way and have the hard-fought-for Ring of the Master
Cat explode at this point. Zap a wand of monster detection or read a scroll of monster detection before using the Fire Orb in the anomaly.
It also damages a Necromancer PC's slaves. It may not kill them, but undead are vulnerable to fire damage, and a partially fried and very
angry extremely experienced level 110 quickling king lich is not something the PC wants to worry about at this point. Leave undead slaves on D: 47.
Pets, companions and slaves cannot cross D: 49 anyway.<p>

<h4 id="3m6">3.22.6 Descending</h4>
<img src="tiles/stairs_d.png" alt="stairs down" align="left">
After all of the orbs are in their proper places, the PC receives the following message:
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
You hear a grating sound in the distance.
</pre></table><p>

This means the up staircase has reversed direction and now points down. There is no way to return to D: 47 at this point. The PC is now committed
to going through D: 49 to D: 50, either to win or die. Once Chaos Gate is closed properly, the staircase will revert to upstairs upon returning to D: 48.<p>
