<h3>Pyramid</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-9-pic.html" target="_blank">Color maps</a><p>

The Pyramid is located in the wilderness, slightly east of the exact center of the map. It can be entered once the PC reaches experience level 13. When this happens, the game
generates a message: "You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in your vicinity." Searching the current location will reveal the papyrus scroll, which is an
invitation to enter the Pyramid. Note the papyrus scroll will not appear in the Animated Forest. It is not necessary to read, or even find, the scroll
for admission to the Pyramid. It asks the PC to come as soon as possible. Do not be fooled by this. It is best to wait as long as possible before entering the Pyramid,
since it is a rather nasty place. The entrance to the Pyramid closes permanently if the PC reaches experience level 17. Ideally the PC should reach experience level 16 and
keep very careful track of her experience points. Approach the Pyramid when the PC is close to achieving level 17, within a couple hundred points. Wander around in the
vicinity of the Pyramid to generate wilderness encounters. Killing monsters in the wilderness should enable the player to fine-tune her experience score to the point where
very few additional points are needed to achieve level 17. Then enter the Pyramid. The first couple of kills in the Pyramid will raise the PC to experience level 17,
maximizing the chances of success in the Pyramid. Keep a <i>very</i> close eye on those experience points. You don't want to accidentally achieve level 17 and have the Pyramid
close, because Rehetep carries two artifacts.<p>

Once the PC has killed Rehetep, the Pyramid remains open permanently. The fact that it closes at PC experience level 17 if Rehetep remains alive is a potential game-breaker. If the PC
drops a Chaos Orb in the Pyramid, then achieves experience level 17 outside without killing Rehetep, the game is over. Since the Chaos Orb is inside an inaccessible location, it will
never be possible to open the passage to D: 49. Note this same scenario can occur with the Ruined City (Minotaur Maze, section <a href="adomgb-2-14.html">2.14</a>).<p>

<h4 id="291">2.9.1 First two levels</h4>
The first level is a large, heavily trapped maze with many secret passages. There is number of guaranteed traps <tt>^</tt>, in addition to a number of non-guaranteed traps present. The location
of the non-guaranteed traps changes from game to game.<p>

The cache of tools <tt>(</tt> at the rightmost edge on the first level is guaranteed and includes thieves picks, climbing set, and pickaxe. The tools are always located on top of a trap.
A careful adventurer might want to kick tools from their initial tile and pick them going through another secret passage &ndash; to avoid triggering potential fireball trap.<p>

The second level is a similar maze-like design, with the upward stairs down a heavily trapped hallway northeast of the starting location. There is no guaranteed equipment here.<p>

Monsters who can be generated in first two levels of the Pyramid consist of the following: skeleton <tt>z</tt> (double chance), jackal <tt>d</tt> (thrice chance), jackalwere <tt>d</tt> (double chance),
mummy <tt>Z</tt> (quadruple chance), ghost <tt>G</tt> (double chance), spectre <tt>Z</tt>, large jackal <tt>d</tt>, jackal demon <tt>&amp;</tt> (double chance), greater mummy <tt>Z</tt>.
Mummies can cause sickness. It is very unwise to enter the Pyramid without some means of dealing with sickness. The fastest and easiest way to cure sickness is with blessed or uncursed curaria
mancox herbs.<p>

<h4 id="292">2.9.2 Top level</h4>
There is a unique feature on this level. The down staircase, represented by the <tt>&gt;</tt> symbol, changes location randomly once when the PC enters the level (unless the PC is wearing ankh).
This forces the PC to fight her way to the new location if a retreat is necessary. Furthermore, the monsters on the level will not follow the PC down the stairs.<p>

The <tt>Z</tt> at the top represents Rehetep, the mummy lord. The remaining yellow <tt>Z</tt>s are mummies. The <tt>&amp;</tt> characters are jackal demons, which have a confusion attack.<p>

<img src="tiles/276.png" alt="mummy" align="left"><img src="tiles/327.png" alt="jackal demon" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Mummy: Level: 1, DV: 12, PV: 8, Hits: 52, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d6, Speed 100.<br>
Jackal demon: Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 4, Hits: 70, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d6+4, Speed 100.</table>
The <tt>@</tt> characters represent a random monster, generally somewhat out of depth, but not terribly so. A potion of exchange can be brought to transform a particularly nasty creature into
something more manageable. Bear in mind that mummies see invisible. If the PC is fortunate enough to have a means of invisibility at this point, use it and take out the mummies first.<p>

If the PC has a means of controlled on demand teleportation, the fight becomes simpler. Rehetep normally recites a speech as soon as the PC moves, waking all the other monsters
on the level. If the PC teleports adjacent to Rehetep on arrival, he does not speak and the PC only has to fight Rehetep and the two jackal demons nearest to him.<p>

<h4 id="2921">2.9.2.1 Rehetep, the mummy lord <tt>Z</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/328.png" alt="Rehetep, the mummy lord" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 18, Hits: 180, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d6+8, Speed 100.</table>
Rehetep sees invisible and in darkness, is immune to cold, death rays, and paralysis. His attacks may cause sickness, and he is highly vulnerable to fire. This is where the wand of
fireballs available from Thrundarr as a quest reward comes in very handy. Do not give up when messages about Rehetep "shrugging off" fire based attacks are generated. He will succumb to
repeated fire attacks. All mummies including Rehetep are also vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course.<p>

Rehetep holds two powerful artifacts, the Ankh and the Ancient Mummy Wrapping.<p>

<h4 id="2922">2.9.2.2 Ankh <tt>'</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item532.png" alt="ankh" align="left">
Note that the [+2, +2] nature of the Ankh is not revealed explicitly except when Greater Identified. Note also that it not only grants the Lucky and Fate smiles
intrinsics, but also increases luck, a hidden property used by the game when calculating dice rolls, etc.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of damage.

<h4 id="2923">2.9.2.3 Ancient Mummy Wrapping <tt>[</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item531.png" alt="amw" align="left">
The artifact Ancient Mummy Wrapping is the only mummy wrapping that weighs 60 stones. Be sure not to confuse it with other mummy wrappings. They are all described as a
"strange wrapping" prior to identification. The resistances granted by the Ancient Mummy Wrapping are considerable and should give clues about how to attack Rehetep.
Note that the combination of cold immunity and the See invisible intrinsic available from the Ancient Mummy Wrapping makes Li-Hon-Kay, a potential 20th Arena fight opponent, much
easier to defeat.<p>
