<h2 id="N">Corruptions</h2>
The forces of Chaos slowly start to get a grip on the world of Ancardia.
Rumor has it that the dark magic used by the forces of Chaos and their
presence itself have corrupting effects on all living beings on Ancardia
and even on the environment itself. Strange mutants have been sighted and
formerly normal humans suddenly were horribly changed.<p>

Be prepared to be faced with these dangers and try to avoid becoming
transformed into a horrible being of Chaos. Although the powers might seem
advantageous, they nearly always will bring doom (or so they say).<p>
