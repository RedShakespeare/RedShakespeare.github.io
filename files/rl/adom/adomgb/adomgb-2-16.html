<h3>Sinister Library of Niltrias</h3>
<a href="adomgb-2-16-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

The Sinister Library of Niltrias is a hidden location in the game that can only be accessed by a journey through the Rift.
It features numerous scrolls and spellbooks, as well as an option of receiving five valuable scrolls of corruption removal. Due to its dangerous
nature and that accessing it requires the PC to have already met the entry requirements to the Rift, though, many players avoid this area entirely.
In order to access the Library, the player must have a climbing set. If their set is destroyed during their fall down the Rift (or the player neglects
to bring one), then they will have to either buy one from the Ratling Dealer or leave the Rift and return with one.<p>

The main feature of the Library is the large assortment of scrolls and spellbooks available. What a character finds in the Library depends on their class &ndash; Wizards find
only spellbooks, while some sections of the library will contain scrolls instead for other character classes. Wizards and Necromancers, furthermore, will find one of
every single spellbook in the game, including the rare (though not terribly useful) spellbook of wish. Non-magical classes are likely to benefit more from scrolls
than spellbooks anyway, although members of other magically-talented classes might feel somewhat irritated to discover fewer spellbooks than a Wizard does.<p>

The southern areas seem to have books for all classes, and there is a spare climbing set <tt>]</tt> located at the end of the hall in bottom left. Note that each book/scroll is
guarded by a random guardian of somewhat high danger level &mdash; ancient black dragons, berserker emperors, master liches, or mimic hiveminds, for example. Any monster
that uses an elemental attack, such as vortices or dragons, must be treated with particular care if the player wishes to avoid damage to valuable spellbooks.
It is wise to bring dragon slaying ammo in case an ancient karmic dragon is generated. Likewise, demon slaying ammo or phase daggers are very nice to have in case a (greater)
moloch is generated.<p>

The second feature of note in the Library is the presence of the Ghost Librarian near the entrance. She is non-hostile and can be talked to. This will typically
result in merely asking the PC to be quiet. If the PC has spent at least 2000 consecutive turns in the Library without making noise (see below for more conditions)
and then <tt>C</tt>hats with the Librarian, she will congratulate the PC on being quiet and will offer a quest to deliver the Weird Tome to the Mad Minstrel. Accepting the quest will place
the Weird Tome in the PC's inventory. The reward for this quest is provided by the Mad Minstrel and consists of 5 cursed scrolls of corruption removal.<p>

The Ghost Librarian will also bless the PC for 2000 turns if <tt>g</tt>iven a scroll or book. This might be helpful for fighting the monsters inside the Library.<p>

The player should be careful to ensure the Ghost Librarian's safety. Since the librarian is non-hostile, the monsters that guard the stacks might potentially attack her.
It's a good idea to use a wand of door creation to seal off the Library's lobby. Even then, monsters that teleport or smash doors might potentially get in and kill her.<p>

<h4 id="2g2">2.16.2 Weird Tome <tt>"</tt></h4>

The Ghost Librarian is the source of an important artifact, the Weird Tome.<p>

<table style="clear:left" class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
-------------------------------- weird tome --------------------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d2
points of damage.
</pre></table><p>

In order to obtain the Weird Tome the PC must have Stealth at 100 upon entering the Library and must spend at least 2000 turns in the Library without <tt>C</tt>hatting to monsters.
The PC also must not have the babbling mouth corruption since it nullifies the Stealth skill. Contrary to what might be expected, casting spells in the Library does not break the
silence check despite requiring the PC to speak (as per in-game lore and the mechanics of being mute).<p>

Getting the Weird Tome sets Literacy to 100. If the PC <tt>C</tt>hats with the Ghost Librarian too soon, she responds with "Respect the Silence!" and the 2000 turn
counter is reset. If 2000 more turns pass in silence, the Weird Tome can still be obtained. The 2000 figure for the turns spent without <tt>C</tt>hatting may not be an absolute.
There may be a die roll for a very small chance that a PC will be unable to get the Weird Tome no matter the length of the wait.<p>

Most characters who attempt to read the Weird Tome are confused for a considerable length of time (20d100 turns). Do not try it in a potentially dangerous
location! You can only read the Weird Tome if you are Bard, have both Literacy and Music at 100, have 50+ Willpower and 60+ Learning. Then the message generated is:<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">
This book is filled with strange texts written in weird letters. You have difficulties concentrating on the text. After a while
you manage to focus your sight on the text. The text contains a strange collection of tunes, songs and instrumental pieces. It seems to be some
kind of code, hinting at some ancient powerful magic, a scroll or something like that... You fail to decipher it.

Research on the Weird Tome is far from complete. See section <a href="adomgb-5.html#55">5.5</a> for details.<p>
