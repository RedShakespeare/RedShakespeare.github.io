<h3>Volcano</h3>
Bergbringer, the stone heart can be corrupted by using it while the PC possesses the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. Doing this gradually causes mountains to turn into volcanoes,
and other terrain to become more mountainous. Entering any volcano on the wilderness map places the PC in the same Volcano dungeon. Leaving this dungeon places the PC on a
random volcano on the wilderness map. This can eventually be used to visit any closed off area on the wilderness map, including the Sinister Library and High Mountain Village,
although it may take a very long time for volcanoes to spawn in the necessary places. The Volcano itself is a 16 level cavernous dungeon with lots of magma and a very high rate
of special dungeon features. It is the second biggest fixed-size dungeon in the game, after the CoC with 50 levels. Visiting the Volcano dungeon is not required to complete this 
quest, but it will become inaccessible upon its conclusion.<p>

<h4 id="2t1">2.29.1 Stopping the cataclysm</h4>
Yggaz, the fool in Terinyo can be tamed by giving him some antediluvian alcohol, found in the Rolf Fortress. 
Leading him all the way to the Ice Queen will cause them to reunite, and after a long dialogue they both dissappear. 
At this point, it will no longer be possible to visit the Volcano Dungeon or to complete any remaining Ice Queen quests, or trade potions with Yggaz. 
This also stops the generation of further volcanoes and renders existing volcanoes dormant, completing the Volcano quest.
Possession of the Weird Fire Starter, found at the bottom of Minotaur Maze, now allows access to the Ultimate Dungeon, provided the Chaos Gate is closed.<p>

<h4 id="2t2">2.29.2 Heart of Ancardia <tt>'</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item832.png" alt="hoa" align="left">
The Heart of Ancardia, an artifact amulet, is found on the ground on the 16th level of the Volcano Dungeon.
It grants +7 Dexterity, the Luck and Fate smiles intrinsics, immunity to fire, and resistance to poison. It appears as a "ruby necklace" when unidentified.
It can be used or zapped to summon a Fire elemental companion at the cost of 1 Mana plus 1 Mana per previous activation of the heart. If a Greater fire elemental companion
is summoned instead, the activation costs an additional 3 Mana. If the PC does not have sufficient Mana to summon a companion, activating the heart will not do anything.<p>
