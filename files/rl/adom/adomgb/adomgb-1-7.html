<h3>Druid Dungeon</h3>
The Druid Dungeon is a dungeon southeast of Terinyo that will appear after the kill Keethrax quest has been assigned. It consists of seven levels, with the corrupted evil druid Keethrax living
on the bottom level.<p>

Much like the Village Dungeon, the Druid Dungeon does not have most dungeon features; altars and tension rooms may be generated, but herbs, forges, etc. generally may not be. The bottom level is
unique in that, aside from Keethrax, only animals may be found on this floor. Unlike other places, animals here are hostile towards PCs of the Druid class. Additionally, animals on Keethrax's
level can't be calmed using the Calm Monster spell, although they may be calmed and tamed by Music.<p>

The following animals are generated on DD: 7 &ndash; cave bear, cave fisher, cave lion, cave lizard, cave tiger, cobra, dire wolf, fire beetle, fire lizard, giant bat, giant centipede,
giant frog, giant lizard, giant raccoon, giant rat, giant slug, giant spider, huge bat, hyena, jackal, large snake, large spider, rabid dog, rat, rattlesnake, silver wolf, tarantula, viper,
wild cat, wolf.<p>

<h4 id="171">1.7.1 Keethrax, the black druid <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/366.png" alt="Keethrax, the black druid" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 4, Hits: 72, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d3+1, Speed: 125.</table>
Keethrax's stats are directly proportional to experience level when first entering DD: 7. As a druid, he maintains a contingent of hostile animals on the final level. These will include felines
(see section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a>) and giant slugs (nasty acid breathers, but their corpses are a source of acid immunity). He is vulnerable to acid and magic missiles, but
little else in the way of magic. He can however be stunned via the Stun Ray spell or the wand, paralyzed with a wand of paralyzation, and blinded with a cursed potion of invisibility.
He casts Darkness, can see in darkness, attacks with missiles (source of sling bullets) and glowing balls, heals himself, while he can drain attributes and use curses in melee range.
He has a corrupting melee attack. All of this makes a formidable enemy for PCs less than experience level ten. Some players regard him as an out-of-depth opponent and defer this quest until
later in the game.<p>

Keethrax always leaves a corpse. Picking up his corpse is a chaotic act, but Guth'Alak will reward non-chaotic PCs with a potion of cure corruption in exchange
for returning Keethrax's corpse to him. Eating the corpse will corrupt (nearly one full corruption). It also results in -1000 alignment drop and attribute changes: +2 Le, +1 To, +3 Ma
and -4 Wi. Unlike most corpses, attribute increases will push the PC through potentials. As with all spellcasting monsters, it may also grant a small increase in maximum PP and an extra +1
to Mana.<p>

<h4 id="172">1.7.2 Black Torc <tt>'</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item579.png" alt="bt" align="left">
Keethrax carries an artifact amulet, the Black Torc, which is permanently cursed. It is good fodder for the Demented Ratling (section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#358">3.5.8</a>).<p style="clear:none">

Since it does not autocurse upon equipping in the missile slot, the Black Torc is a passable thrown weapon, but unfortunately does not
benefit from or train any weapon skill and does not grant the benefit of any of its intrinsics while worn in the missile slot or any hand.
It does still slay undead, so is powerful enough against them to justify its use.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
------------------------ black torc [+4, +2] (+10 spd) ------------------------

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +2.
