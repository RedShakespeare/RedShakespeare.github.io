<h2 id="E">Professions</h2>
In ADOM, every character belongs to a certain profession which
describes what he learned in his youth. This profession determines his special abilities and starting equipment
(equipment is also dependent on race). Additionally, each profession receives a
skill package to account for the knowledge you gain during your
apprenticeship (see the section on skills for a complete list of all
skills available in the game).<p>

Finally, each and every profession will provide special powers to
the character once a specific experience level is gained. The more
powerful the character gets, the better these abilities will be. Some
abilities are magical, some are natural talents, some are automatic,
others must be used manually, but each and every ability will serve to
simplify some aspect of your adventuring life. Special powers are
gained at levels 6, 12, 18, 25, 32, 40 and 50. All these special
powers are usually invoked (if this is necessary) with the <tt>Ctrl-x</tt> command
&ndash; if this keybinding does not work for you check your online help
(press <tt>?</tt>-<tt>K</tt>).<p>

<h3 id="E1">Profession List</h3>
The following professions can be chosen:<p>

<h4 id="E11">Archer</h4>
Archers are deadly shots. Although the name of their profession
seems to imply this, not all of them prefer to use bows. The race of
an archer has great influence on their preferred missile weapon.
Archers are expert fighters in missile combat, rarely missing their
targets and trained to hit the vital spots of their opponents. In
close combat, archers are less formidable, although they are still
dangerous.<p>

Archers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Archery,
Climbing, Concentration, Dodge, Fletchery, Listening, and Stealth.<p>

At higher levels Archers are the most deadly marksmen in all
Ancardia. At level 6 a missile attack takes up but 800 energy points.
At level 12 the range for their missile attacks is doubled. At level
18 they are a lot more productive when applying fletchery. At level
25 missile attacks cost but 600 energy points. At level 32 they
become able to completely dodge enemy missiles. At level 40 missiles
attacks have a 20% chance to penetrate armor and at level 50 they are
able to hit several targets with one missile.<p>

<h4 id="E12">Assassin</h4>
Assassins are a dark and mysterious profession. They are
trained to end the life of their opponents quickly and silently. Many
of them favor poisons to achieve this goal.<p>

Assassins are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Alertness,
Archery, Backstabbing, Climbing, Detect Traps, Dodge, Find Weakness,
Pick Locks, Stealth, and Two Weapon Combat.<p>

At higher levels Assassins get a lot more deadly in their trade. At
level 6 they can create poison from any potion (except for water and
fruit juice). At level 12 their backstabbing powers get a lot more
deadly. At level 18 the range of their missile attacks is increased
by 30%. At level 25 their chance to score critical hits is increased
by 20%. At level 32 the dodge bonus they gain is doubled. At level
40 they become immune to poison. At level 50 they receive a small
chance to score instant killing hits. This chance is based upon the
level of the target.<p>

<h4 id="E13">Barbarian</h4>
Barbarians hail from the harsh northern lands of
Ancardia, from the roughest mountain peaks, the wildest hills and the
most remote forests. What they lack in equipment, they more than
equalize with their great strength, enormous toughness and deadly
weaponry. Barbarians are very well experienced in the arts of battle
and are well prepared to cope with the dangers of the wilderness.<p>

Barbarians are trained in the following skills: Athletics, Climbing,
Dodge, First Aid, Herbalism, Stealth, Survival, Swimming, Two Weapon
Combat, and Woodcraft.<p>

High-level Barbarians are fearsome fighters. At level 6 they learn to
deliver mighty blows that cause double damage (for the cost of 2500
energy points). At level 12 moving costs but 750 energy points. At
level 18 they can deliver tremendous blows that cause triple damage
(for the cost of 4000 energy points). At level 25 they start to gain
+1d4 additional hit points per level. At level 32 Barbarians gain a
one-time bonus of +3 to strength and toughness. At level 40 they gain
a +10 damage bonus with each melee attack when fighting as a true
berserker (which basically means that they have to fight naked,
e.g. without any armor, and switching the tactics rating to the
appropriate setting). At level 50 melee attacks take up but 800
energy points when fighting as a true berserker.
IMPORTANT: Note that both the mighty and the tremendous blow count
only for the first blow, even if the character is delivering a series
of blows (because he wields more than one weapon, etc.).<p>

<h4 id="E14">Bard</h4>
Bards are musicians, entertainers and entrepreneurs. They try
to make an easy living by telling good stories for a meal. Most of
them are below average fighters and don't possess much equipment.
This is balanced by their knack to stumble upon strange items. Apart
from that, bards make fast friends with strange beings at times. A
bard starts his dungeoneering life with one loyal monster or animal
companion. Once a bard has become friends with another being, this
friendship lasts for a lifetime. Many legendary bards in Ancardia
were accompanied by monster or animal companions of equal fame. It is
said that talented bards are able to calm the spirit of a beast with
their ethereal music.<p>

Bards are not trained in specific skills (except for Music), but
rather receive a randomly determined group of skills. They also receive
more skills than any other character profession.<p>

As Bards advance in level they become more and more versatile. At
level 6 they receive one additional free skill increase per
advancement. At level 12 they gain +1d3 skill levels in 6 randomly
chosen weapon skills. At level 18 they receive a base score of 80 +
(10 * Learning score) + (20 * Mana score) in four randomly chosen
spells. At level 25 they receive 6 random skills (or improve their
abilities in up to 6 skills). At level 32 they double their hit point
regeneration speed. At level 40 they double their mana point
regeneration rate. At level 50 they receive a bonus of +6 to all
attributes.<p>

<h4 id="E15">Beastfighter</h4>
Beastfighters are partly mystic, partly primitive
warriors who excel at weaponless combat. They are lightly armored but
extremely tough and fearsome opponents due to their weaponless
fighting style. They are well accustomed to wilderness settings and
very resistant to poisons &ndash; especially to animal poisons. The more
experienced a beastfighter becomes, the more deadly he is in melee
combat. Beastfighters are especially likely to score critical hits
when fighting animals in melee combat.<p>

Beastfighters are trained in the following skills: Athletics,
Climbing, Dodge, Healing, Herbalism, Listening, Stealth, Survival, and
Swimming.<p>

With increasing experience, Beastfighters perfect their natural
fighting style and their attunement to the wild beasts. At level 6
they become poison resistant and at level 12 their wild fighting style
makes them stun resistant. At level 18 movement costs them but 700
energy points. At level 25 they can summon 2d2 cave bears or silver
wolves for the cost of permanently losing one mana point (which
eventually regenerates after a lot of time has passed). At level 32
they become able to exchange positions with hostile monsters. At
level 40 they can stun opponents on critical hits and at level 50 they
gain +6 to both strength and toughness.<p>

<div class="resb">
<h4 id="E16">Chaos Knight</h4>
Chaos Knights are the dark war leaders of the legions
of Chaos. Former members of the common races, they have fallen to the lure
of Chaos, having become corrupted and tempted. Now they serve as
mighty warriors and brutal fighters on the war-torn battlefields of
Ancardia. Clad in mighty armors and wielding brutal weapons they slay
their foes left and right and cherish the brutal massacres in which
they partake. They are lost to Law and Balance and their only aspiration
is to become the mightiest warriors of Chaos, potentially usurping
their leaders and toppling their reign to instill an even more brutal
regime.<p>

Chaos Knights are trained in the following skills: Athletics,
Backstabbing, Dodge, Find Weakness and Two Weapon Combat.<p>

The more powerful Chaos Knights become, the more effectively they wield
the forces of Corruption. At level 6 chaos knights begin to regenerate
wounds when they become infused with corruption. At level 12 they receive
a speed bonus of +1d(level) (determined each turn anew). At level 18
they gain a weapon skill level bonus of +1d8 with each melee weapon
they wield (determined each turn anew). At level 25 they receive a random
bonus of +1d(number of corruptions) to Strength, Dexterity and Toughness
(determined each turn anew). At level 32 corruption starts to work
more slowly on chaos knights (only 50% effectiveness if they have 10
or more corruptions, only 75% effectiveness if they have 5 or more
corruptions). At level 40 they receive a damage bonus of +1d(level)
when fighting with two-handed melee weapons (determined anew each turn).
At level 50 they receive a PV bonus of +4d6 (determined anew each turn).
</div><p>

<h4 id="E17">Druid</h4>
Druids are nature priests. They worship the Old Gods and
regard all nature as a holy thing to worship and protect. Their
specialty are spells of nature and protection. It is said that no
animal will willingly harm a druid.<p>

Druids are trained in the following skills: Climbing, Concentration,
First Aid, Gardening, Healing, Herbalism, Listening, Literacy, Survival,
Swimming, and Woodcraft.<p>

At higher levels, Druids become extremely attuned to nature itself.
At level 6 they learn to evade wilderness encounters whenever they
choose to do so. At level 12 they regenerate power points twice as
fast as usual while in the wilderness. At level 18 they become immune
to all weather effects. At level 25 they are able to summon 1d3 major
animals as servants at the cost of 1d3 mana points (an almost
permanent loss, as it only regenerates after a very long period of
time). At level 32 they regenerate hit points twice as fast as usual
while in the wilderness. At level 40 they become immune to lightning.
Finally, they suffer 10% less corruption from all such attacks at
level 50 due to their close connection to nature.<p>

<div class="resb">
<h4 id="E18">Duelist</h4>
A Duelist emphasizes physical and mental acuity, and
precision in all things. Thus, the ability to accurately perceive
their surroundings, and gracefully move through them, along with an
appreciation for the fine arts that help separate them from their
more thuggish contemporaries. They rely on the swiftness of their
strikes and their agility to keep them safe from harm. Duelists
differ between races however &ndash; while a high elven duelist might
elegantly skewer his opponents with a rapier while darting through
their defenses, a trollish duelist's idea of precision might be the
simple fact that their size, reach, and strength allows them to lunge
at their opponents from an amazing range and smash them over the head
before they can respond, while their mental acuity might be the simple
zen of knowing nothing but the clubbing, letting nothing interfere
with their 'art'.<p>

Duelists are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Athletics,
Concentration, Dodge, Find Weakness, Healing, Law.<p>

All Duelists rely on fighting unencumbered and using a single
one-handed weapon (and no shields!). When endowed in this way they
receive a multitude of benefits: all Duelists receive an extra +1
to-hit bonus per weapon skill rank and +1 to damage per two weapon
skill ranks with their weapon. At level 6 they require 15 energy
points less for melee attacks per weapon skill rank for their
weapon. At level 12 they receive an extra +2 DV bonus for each weapon
skill rank in their selected weapon. At level 18 they can glove
slap opponents by giving gauntlets to them (for a 2d3-turn stun).
At level 25 their armor penetration probability is increased by +20%.
At level 32 their dexterity increases by +12. At level 40 they gain a
+6 weapon skill rank bonus for all one-handed melee weapon skills. At
level 50 they receive a +20 speed bonus.</div><p>

<h4 id="E19">Elementalist</h4>
Elementalists are magicians specialized on dealing
with the four elements: fire, water, earth and air. Their spells
specifically deal with those elements and their magic equipment
reflects this preference, too. Elementalists normally don't use
written magic but employ powers they harness from within. Their magic
thus is somewhat limited in one way and a lot more powerful in other
ways. Elementalists generally use a less scientific approach to magic
than wizards usually do.<p>

Elementalists are trained in the following skills: Climbing,
Concentration, Gemology, Healing, Listening, Literacy, Metallurgy, and
Swimming.<p>

Experienced Elementalists use very special powers provided by their
close elemental attunement. At level 6 they become fire resistant, at
level 12 they become shock resistant. At level 18 they are immune to
all weather effects. At level 25 they are able to breathe water. At
level 32 they can unleash an elemental storm at the cost of 120 power
points which fires a random bolt (fire, lightning or frost) into each
of the eight available directions, starting from the position of the
elementalist. At level 40 they can summon an elemental as a pet.
This forces them to permanently sacrifice two mana points (which
eventually regenerate &ndash; albeit after a very long period of time). At
level 50 they can automatically burrow through stone (at the cost of
20 power points and 1500 energy).<p>

<h4 id="E1a">Farmer</h4>
Even among the most average folks, there are some valiant and
larger-than-life persons who are born to achieve more than their
parents and grand parents. After the news about the impending danger
had spread throughout the lands, those people started their journey to
the location in the Drakalor Chain which might change their destiny &ndash;
and the destiny of their world. Farmers are neither great fighters
nor skilled magicians, but they possess inner strength and endurance
from years of labor. Often they are accompanied by their trusted
dogs. They are accustomed to hunger and hardship and often have very
little to lose compared to the amount of fame they might be able to
win. Equipped with a broad knowledge about herbs and food, they are
probably the best prepared profession (except for barbarians and
beastfighters) for extensive travels.<p>

Farmers are trained in the following skills: Archery, Bridge building,
Cooking, First Aid, Fletchery, Food Preservation, Gardening, Haggling,
Herbalism, Smithing, Stealth, Survival, and Woodcraft.<p>

The more experienced Farmers become, the better they adjust to their
hard circumstances of life. At level 6 their carrying capacity is
doubled due to their training and experience with moving around great
loads during harvest time. At level 12 they need only half as much
food as everybody else (except for monks who also know how to survive
on very little). At level 18 they learn to pick herbs with a lot
more skill to select the better ones. At level 25 they learn
about making iron rations from corpses. At level 32 they receive
better chances to increase their physical attributes and physical
attribute potentials. At level 40 they gain a +3 bonus to strength
and toughness. At level 50 they have become so much attuned to basic
nature that all corruption effects are reduced by 30%.<p>

<h4 id="E1b">Fighter</h4>
Fighters are simple warriors who have learned how to best face
an opponent in melee combat. Most of them are well armed and armored.
Fighters are tough and strong due to their physical training.<p>

Fighters are trained in the following skills: Archery, Athletics,
Dodge, Find Weakness, Metallurgy, Stealth, Swimming, and Two Weapon
Combat.<p>

With increasing experience, Fighters become more able to efficiently
use armor as a means of protection. Only the PV bonus of helmets,
body armor, shields, gauntlets, cloaks, girdles, and boots will be
improved in this way. At level 6 a fighter gains +7% to PV from such
items, at level 18 this bonus is increased to +15%, at level 32 it's
+25%. At level 12 fighters gain a +50% bonus to DV adjustment
provided by the dodge skill. At level 25 their chance to score
critical hits is increased by 10%. At level 40 fighters are able to
use a powerful bash attack which causes more damage (+20%) and has a
greater chance to stun their opponents. The downside of this attack
is that it costs 500 additional energy points to use. At level 50
fighters learn to use a powerful all-round attack costing 3500 energy
points. This attack can be used against every opponent in the
immediate vicinity of the fighter.<p>

<h4 id="E1c">Healer</h4>
Healers are exactly that &ndash; masters of the arts of healing,
well equipped with magical healing items and means to examine
patients. Most of them are very robust and resistant to poisons and
diseases. Healers are not great fighters. They prefer to save lives rather
than to take them, although they are nonetheless able to live through
fights.<p>

Healers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Concentration,
Cooking, Find Weakness, First Aid, Healing, Herbalism, and Literacy.<p>

Experienced Healers have a vast array of means at their disposal to
soothe the pain of living beings, to treat diseases and poisons and to
prevent suffering. At level 6 they regenerate wounds at twice the
normal speed, at level 12 they triple their recovery rate. At level
18 they become able to use both the Healing and the First Aid skill on
others (and not only themselves). Starting with level 25 they
automatically gain access to the following spells: Calm Monster, Cure
Light Wounds, Slow Poison and Cure Disease (with each additional level
their knowledge increases). Starting with level 32 they gain 2d3
additional hit points per level. At level 40 they gain access to the
following spells: Cure Serious Wounds, Neutralize Poison (again their
knowledge increases with each new level). At level 50 they almost
immediately recover from the effects of disease, bleeding and poison
and gain a +8 bonus to their toughness score.<p>

<h4 id="E1d">Merchant</h4>
Merchants are masters of trade and bartering. They almost
all are very wealthy, charming and experts in communication. Each
merchant specializes in trading with a certain type of magical items
during their apprenticeship. At the beginning of their career, they
are equipped with a sample of items to trade with (or use). Merchants
are neither well-armed nor well-armored and have to be careful in
fights. Should they encounter one of the rare dungeon shops, they
will probably make some great deals.<p>

Merchants are trained in the following skills: Appraising, Detect Item
Status, Gemology, Haggling, Herbalism, Literacy, Metallurgy, Pick
Pockets, and Survival.<p>

Experienced Merchants become true masters of their trade &ndash; being able
to sell almost anything to anyone and also being able to haggle for
the best prices. At level 6 shop prices for Merchants will be lowered
by 20%. At level 12 their carrying capacity is doubled. At level 18
shop prices will be lowered by 40%. At level 25 they no longer are
affected by any kind of weather. At level 32 shop prices are lowered
by 60%. At level 40 they learn to calm monsters by giving away items.
At level 50 their carrying capacity is tripled (due to their enormous
talent of organization). Finally at that level they also learn a magic
spell that allows them to create new items.<p>

<h4 id="E1e">Mindcrafter</h4>
Mindcrafters use a very exotic and very different
magic. They utilize their mental powers to evoke astonishing effects.
Mindcrafters are very rare and only few people have ever heard about
them. While they are physically weak, they are mentally extremely
strong and resistant.<p>

Mindcrafters are trained in the following skills: Concentration,
Gemology, Haggling, Herbalism, Literacy, Music, and Stealth.<p>

Experienced Mindcrafters master various mental powers. At level 6
they learn to quickly recover from confusion attacks. At level 12
they become able to sense the amount of enemies within a limited area
(that is the current level). Starting with level 18 they gain +1d6
additional power points per level since they manage to unlock
previously untapped mental energy sources. At level 25 their
willpower is increased by +5. At level 32 they can block some of the
corruption they suffer when contacting beings of Chaos. At level 40
they unlock even more unused areas of the brain and from then on gain
+3d5 additional power points (cumulative with the bonus from level 18)
per level. At level 50 they finally manage to resist some of the
damage they suffer when contacting undead: damage is halved (see the
section on Mindcraft for details).<p>

<h4 id="E1f">Monk</h4>
Monks are able martial artists striving to achieve perfect
mastery of body, mind and spirit. They are experts at fighting
unarmed, very good at dodging attacks and strong of will. Monks need
to be unencumbered to be able to use their special martial art powers.
Monks take vows of poverty at their initiation to prevent distraction
by worldly means.<p>

Monks are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Athletics,
Concentration, Dodge, Find Weakness, Healing, Literacy, and Stealth.<p>

The further Monks advance, the more they hone their movement skills and
unarmed combat powers. At level 6 monks learn to use a circular kick
with which they can hit every opponent in the vicinity (but also all
friends, so be careful). Using this kick costs 2500 energy points.
At level 12 a normal move costs them but 800 energy points, at level
18 but 600 energy points. At level 25 monks become able to change
positions with hostile opponents. At level 32 they can score instant
kills in melee combat against up to human-sized creatures. At level
40 they can do so against humanoids of any size. At level 50 they
have become so attached to the flow of the universe that they actually
are able to resist Chaos to a certain limit &ndash; Chaos effects are
lowered by 10%.<p>

<h4 id="E1g">Necromancer</h4>
Necromancers are practitioners of the dark arts.
Though not very effective in melee combat, their spells are deadly and
dangerous. Their most horrible power, though, is the ability to animate
corpses and use them as slaves. Luckily, only humanoid corpses can be
used in this evil way. Necromancers are outlawed and despised in most
places and feared and avoided like the plague in all other locations.<p>

Necromancers are able to command the slaves they create. Their slaves
will follow these commands without questioning. To invoke a command, you
need to press <tt>Ctrl-x</tt>.<p>

Necromancers are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Appraising,
Concentration, Find Weakness, Food Preservation, Herbalism, Literacy,
Necromancy, and Stealth.<p>

With increasing experience, Necromancers master all aspects of
undeath. At level 6 they slowly develop a resistance to all special
attacks from undead (like strength drain or paralyzation). The base
chance for resistance is equal to 40% + 1% per level of the
necromancer. At level 12 they learn to turn undead. At level 18 they
are able to raise all humanoid corpses in sight as ghuls. These
corpses quickly decompose and turn to ashes after a number of turns.
Each animated corpse drains 10 power points. At level 25 they can use
the dreaded Shadow Touch, which allows them to absorb the life energy
of enemies when fighting bare-handed and wounding an enemy. At level
32 they can raise all corpses in sight as wraiths (similar to the
power at level 18). Each animated corpse drains 20 power points. At
level 40 they have to pay but one-half of the usual Necromancy cost
(see the skill description) when animating undead of a power level up
to spectres. At level 50 they finally learn to overcome Death herself
and are able to return to the living when killed, if their Toughness
at the point of death was 10 or higher. Coming back in this way
demands a high price. They lose one-half of their toughness and
one-half of their hit points permanently.<p>

<h4 id="E1h">Paladin</h4>
Paladins are noble fighters (from the point of view of
their respective race&hellip; an orc paladin is <i>very</i> different from a
human paladin). They are well trained both in physical activities
(not as well as fighters, but still very good) and in philosophical
activities (not as good as priests, but&hellip;). Paladins are generally
very well equipped by their respective churches. Many of them possess
blessed items.<p>

Paladins are trained in the following skills: Athletics,
Concentration, Dodge, Healing, Law (if they are lawful initially),
Literacy, Stealth, Swimming, and Two Weapon Combat.<p>

With increasing experience, Paladins gain holy powers fueled by their
strong beliefs and their religious upbringing. Due to the nature of
these powers, they are not able to use them if they aren't in decent
standing with their deity. At level 6 they can cure disease once per
1000 turns. At level 12 they gain the ability to turn undead (this
action costs 3000 energy points to use). At level 18 they can
discover the alignment of a beast by simply looking at it. At level
25 they receive a protective aura which gives them +1DV per 2 levels
against chaotics (if they are lawful), lawful ones (if they are
chaotic) or non-neutral opponents (if they are neutral) while in melee
combat. At level 32 they can use a healing touch once per 1000 turns
to cure (level-24)d6 points of damage. When reaching level 40 they
become highly resistant to some special melee attack powers used by
undead beasts and demons (specifically, they become resistant to
strength drain, toughness drain, sickness and paralyzation). At level
50 they are strengthened by their beliefs so much that all corruption
effects are reduced by 30%.<p>

<h4 id="E1i">Priest</h4>
Priests serve the various gods. They receive magical powers
from their gods but are servants for their whole lifetime. Many of
them carry holy items.<p>

Priests are trained in the following skills: Concentration, Detect
Item Status, First Aid, Healing, Herbalism, Literacy, and Music.<p>

With increasing experience Priests gain holy powers fueled by their
strong beliefs and their religious upbringing. Due to the nature of
these powers, they are not able to use them if they aren't in decent
standing with their deity. At level 6 priests can turn undead. At
level 12 all spell costs are reduced by 10%. At level 18 all spell
costs are reduced by 25%. At level 25 all spell costs are reduced by
50%. At level 32 Priests are allowed to pray twice as often as anybody
else. At level 40 they are able to destroy minor undead (skeletons,
zombies, ghuls, shadows, ghosts, wights, wraiths, ghost bats, slow
shadows, mummies, corpse fiends and shadow centipedes). At level 50
they are able to destroy major undead (liches, spectres, vampires,
revenants, skeletal warriors, ghost lords, shadow trolls, master
liches, shadow lords, greater mummies and steel zombies).<p>

<h4 id="E1j">Ranger</h4>
Rangers are fighters favoring natural environments. They are
excellent trackers and masters at fighting with two weapons. Most of
them are wearing light armor to retain their mobility but in turn are
well armed. Many rangers carry missile weapons.<p>

Rangers are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Archery,
Athletics, Climbing, Dodge, Food Preservation, Healing, Herbalism,
Survival, Swimming, Two Weapon Combat, and Woodcraft.<p>

The more experience Rangers gain, the more attuned to nature they
become. At level 6 they are a lot more capable to survive in the
wilderness through the means of the Survival skill as they find a lot
more food in far less time. They also become immune to all negative
weather effects since they have by now learned to avoid all related
problems. At level 12 Rangers are no longer slowed down by terrain
effects. At level 18 the range of all missile attacks is increased by
+4. At level 25 they can automatically evade all wilderness encounters.
At level 32 and 50 the weight of two weapons used at the same time can
be doubled/quadrupled without incurring negative effects. Starting at
level 40 movement costs but 750 energy points.<p>

Note for the special power at levels 32/50: usually your to-hit
adjustment for fighting with two weapons is determined in the
following way:<p>
<ul>
<li>Take (Two weapon combat / 20) as a basic bonus.
<li>Subtract 6 if you are not playing a Ranger.
<li>Subtract MAX(0, (Weight of the two weapons / 10) - 6).
<li>If you are a Ranger of level 32-49 it is "Subtract MAX(0, (Weight of the two weapons / 20) - 6)"
<li>If you are a Ranger of level 50 it is "Subtract MAX(0, (Weight of the two weapons / 40) - 6)"
</ul><p>

<h4 id="E1k">Thief</h4>
Need we say more? For the sake of completeness: Thieves are
very good at stealing, opening locks, finding and disarming traps and
other secretive activities.<p>

Thieves are trained in the following skills: Alertness, Appraising,
Backstabbing, Climbing, Detect Traps, Disarm Traps, Listening, Pick
Locks, Pick Pockets, and Stealth.<p>

Highly experienced Thieves are masters of stealth, trickery and
robbery. At level 6 Thieves automatically use the search command on
every step they make. At level 12 they get a lot more deadly with
backstabbing attacks. At level 18 they become able to pilfer shops
due to their exceptional agility and skill (but take care of
experienced shopkeepers &ndash; they might be very vigilant!). At level 25
thieves learn very deadly (and dirty!) fighting tactics allowing them
to stun humanoid monsters with critical hits (a good kick at the right
time does wonders). At level 32 they manage to pick the best stuff
from other folks' pockets, occasionally even discovering highly
valuable items. At level 40 their speed is increased by +20. At
level 50 they are invisible as long as they are adjacent to a wall due
to their exceptional stealth (but make sure that you don't carry any
light source!).<p>

<h4 id="E1l">Weaponsmith</h4>
Weaponsmiths are crafty men and women able to repair
damaged metal equipment and improve items. Weaponsmiths normally are
well-equipped and carry the tools of their trade. They are strong and
resilient, hardened by many hours of strenuous work.<p>

Weaponsmiths are trained in the following skills: Appraising,
Athletics, Concentration, Detect Traps, Find Weakness, Haggling,
Metallurgy, and Smithing.<p>

Weaponsmiths perfect their skills at higher experience levels. At
level 6 they become able to melt all metal items into ingots. At
level 12 they can forge items four times as fast as everyone else. At

<h4 id="E1m">Wizard</h4>
Wizards are masters of the 'art'. They wield great
magical powers and are able to create fireballs, lightning strikes
and magical protection spells. Their great magical powers are
balanced by their mediocre fighting abilities. Most mages spend their
lives studying books and conducting arcane experiments in hidden
laboratories and thus have next to no time to practice their physical
skills.<p>

Wizards are trained in the following skills: Alchemy, Concentration,
Healing, Herbalism, Literacy, Stealth, and Ventriloquism.<p>

With increasing power, Wizards become more and more skilled in the
magical arts. At level 6 all spell costs are reduced by 10%, at level
12 all costs are reduced by 20% and at level 18 all costs are reduced
by 40%. Starting with level 25 they slowly gain experience in one
randomly chosen spell per level. At level 32 they become able to
recharge wands (but no wand can be recharged more than once by a Wizard).
Recharging costs 50 power points per charge. If the Wizard tries to
overcharge the wand, he risks losing one mana point permanently. At
level 40 Wizards learn to uncurse items. This permanently costs one
mana point. At level 50 they finally get basic knowledge in all
commonly known spells.<p>
