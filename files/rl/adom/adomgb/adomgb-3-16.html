<h3>Cat Lord <tt>f</tt></h3>
<img src="tiles/107.png" alt="Cat Lord" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 5, Hits: 800, Attacks: 3, Damage: 4d8+8, Speed: 120.</table>
The Cat Lord is found on D: 35 or D: 36. The level message "This level somehow seems to be removed from the rest of the world." is generated upon entering the
level. Note that teleportation is not allowed on the level and ceiling traps may therefore be generated. If the PC has killed no cats, the PC may <tt>C</tt>hat with
the Cat Lord, in which case the following message is generated:<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">
The cat lord growls: "Thou hast respected the cat race. Thus I shall grant upon you this gift."<br>
The cat lord suddenly is gone. Nothing but a tiny ring is left of him.
</table><p>

In this case, congratulations are due. The PC has the most powerful ring in the game, the artifact Ring of the Master Cat.<p>

If the PC has killed cats, the Cat Lord will be hostile. His power is dependent on the number of cats killed: he gains 10 HP for each cat killed, and 1 level
for each 25 cats killed, but max level 20. The Cat Lord is a very difficult opponent. Consequently he is worth many experience
points. PCs desperate for experience may wish to forfeit the annoying quest and ring for the experience. The Cat Lord is vulnerable to poison, blinding, stunning, webs, paralysis, and
humanoid slaying. However, he is fast, and moves as if he's wearing seven league boots. He also tends to be invisible, so the PC should be able to see invisible. If the PC wants
to melee him, he must be disabled. Paralysis or stunning from the spells or wands tend to be shrugged off but will eventually work. He also shrugs Web, but will get stuck in the
webs themselves. Arrows of darkness or thunder work well, as does throwing potions of blindness or cursed potions of invisibility. After disabling him start hammering hard
with your favorite humanoid slayer till he falls. Keep a close eye in case he breaks out of the disability though, and keep a good healing source on standby. A few blasts from
a wand of poison can help shorten the fight a bit.<p>

To missile him, get him stuck in webs and pepper him full of humanoid slaying ammo that has been dipped in poison. It can be best to lure him to a different level so you can
teleport around freely. That way you can fill a corridor with webs and keep teleporting to each end of it, shooting at him as he keeps getting stuck.<p>

Bolt spells aren't greatly effective, though persistence may take him down eventually. Ball spells work beautifully though. You can even just disable him using one of the above methods
and keep using a well charged wand of fireballs. He tends to panic fairly easily, in which case Improved Fireball can be used to great effect to take him down. In this case it's best
to target the spell at a tile next to him &ndash; if the center of the explosion is aimed straight at him then he'll stop panicking and pursue the PC. Aim next to him and he'll stay covering
in a corner while being slowly roasted to death.<p>

If you have killed cats and just want to avoid the fearsome Cat Lord then it may be worth luring him to another level to teleport around him, though it does mean having to put up
with a round of attacks as you go up or down the stairs.<p>

Note the following bug: the game uses the kill list to determine if the PC has killed cats <i>upon entering</i> the Cat Lord's level. This means the PC can
slaughter cats indiscriminately on or below the Cat Lord's level after entering then receive the ring.<p>

Also see section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a> for more on the subject.<p>

<h4 id="3g1">3.16.1 Ring of the Master Cat <tt>=</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/item204.png" alt="rotmc" align="left">
The ring is enormously helpful in the end game, particularly because it grants +16 to Dexterity when the Dexterity is being destroyed by
corruption. Note that if a PC kills a cat whilst wearing the ring, it will be lost in an explosion &ndash; about 30-100 HP.
Cats spawned on dungeon levels will also be non-hostile if the ring is blessed; though this does not include cats that are summoned or spawned in tension rooms.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
--------------- ring of the master cat [+0, +5] {Dx+16} (+16 spd) ---------------

Weight: 1s

When worn it modifies DV by +0 and PV by +5.

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +16.
It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee.
It modifies your speed by +16.
It makes Fate smile upon you.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.

(if the ring is blessed, cats are generated non-hostile, except tension rooms and vaults)
