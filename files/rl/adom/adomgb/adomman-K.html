<h2 id="K">Experience and Gaining Levels</h2>
Each PC in ADOM is rated by his experience level. A character starts at
level 1 (a newly created adventurer) and might be able to advance to higher
levels by collecting experience points. Experience points are mostly gained
by killing monsters, but there might be other ways to learn&hellip; try to find
out for yourself.<p>

To advance to a higher level, you have to collect a certain number of
experience points. How many points you have to collect for your next level
is determined by the following categories: race, class, and attributes.
Generally, you need more experience points to advance if you are very good
in one or more of these categories, you need less experience points to
advance if you are below average in one or more of those categories.<p>

Whenever you have earned a certain amount of experience points, you
increase in level. Increasing in levels is a very good thing to do because
this brings many benefits. Whenever you go up a level, you get better in
combat, receive more hit points and more magical power (depending on your
class and race). You are also allowed to increase your skill values. The
number of skill improvements depends on your learning score. Finally, you
get a chance to raise (or lower) your attributes. This decision is made by
the game and is heavily influenced by your class, your experience level and
your actions during game play. There are finite limits to the number of
times you might be able to increase attribute scores in this way. Once you
have reached your natural potential, no more training of whatever kind will
help to increase attributes. Only magical means will further enhance your
attribute scores.<p>
