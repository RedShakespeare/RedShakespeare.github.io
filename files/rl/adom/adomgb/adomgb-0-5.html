Books and scrolls can be <tt>r</tt>ead. Learned spells are cast &ndash; <tt>Z</tt>. You can also mark learned spells for quick selection via the <tt>:Z</tt> command.
Mindcraft is invoked by pressing <tt>Ctrl-i</tt>. It only works for Mindcrafters though. Magical writing sets are <tt>u</tt>sed.
<big>As of R+, spells cannot be cast while wielding two shields.</big><p>

<h4 id="051">0.5.1 Spells</h4>
There is a description of available spells in the <a href="adomman-L.html">ADOM Manual</a>. The range and damage information has been removed from the manual in ADOM 1.1.x+.
Accordingly they are tabulated below.<p>

Wizards, Priests, Druids, and Necromancers are 10 times more likely to find spellbooks. Paladins 2.5 times.<p>

<h4 id="0511">0.5.1.1 Casting</h4>
Note that spells become more costly to cast (in terms of PP) as the number of available castings decreases. Thus a spell will increase in cost as the number
of available castings decreases below 100 or so, becoming very noticeable as the number drops below about 30. This is class dependent but will affect all
classes to differing extents. Note also that the number of available castings is not a simple "decrement by one each time the spell is cast" type of formula.
Again depending on class, the difficulty of casting the spell and probably other factors this will vary. For example, casting Light with 1000 castings available
to a level 40 Wizard may decrease the available castings by one, while casting Death Ray with 20 castings available with a level 30 Archer may reduce the
available castings to zero. These are purely hypothetical examples but should give an idea of the trends.<p>

<h4 id="0512">0.5.1.2 Ball spells</h4>
Ball spells are extraordinarily useful since no monsters shrug them off. They are wonderful when the PC is surrounded, of course.
It is worth switching to Coward tactics and waiting to be completely surrounded before casting. Since they are relatively costly in terms of PP, it is useful to
destroy the maximum number of enemies with each casting. Fire magic is particularly effective against cold-based creatures and undead including mummies.
Cold magic is particularly effective against fire-based creatures. The diameter of ball spells is dependent upon Willpower / 8.
However, this diameter only increases as a multiple of sixteen since ball spells radiate symmetrically; the minimum diameter is two. Therefore getting Willpower to 24,
for instance, does not increase the diameter. Willpower must be increased to 32 for the diameter to increase to four, 48 for the diameter to increase to six,
64 for the diameter to increase to eight, 80 for diameter of 10, and 96 for diameter of 12.<p>

<h4 id="0513">0.5.1.3 Wish</h4>
Wish is a unique spell. It is very difficult to learn, probably impossible if the PC has teleportitis. Such PCs must travel to a location where teleportation is impossible,
such as the the Assassin's Guild, the Tomb of the High Kings or the elemental temples (the desirability is in that order due to background corruption in all of those locations).
Furthermore, PCs will usually reach Starving! status while attempting to learn Wish. Removing all artifacts (except those that increase Learning) and Invisibility-granting
items prior to reading the book is recommendable. Otherwise, their food consumption penalties really stack given the long amount of time it takes to learn Wish. Other tactics
to deal with this include eating a blessed stomafillia to become Bloated, waiting just until the PC returns to Satiated, then eating another blessed stomafillia. It may be
necessary to drink additional satiating potions, such as potions of toughness or potential toughness, even when the double blessed stomafillia tactic is used. Alternatively,
PCs without Teleportitis can use a room that has the "rich flavor" special effect, where PCs will never become hungry. Wish is extraordinarly expensive to cast and also drains
a random attribute -10 when cast. If the PC must cast it, be prepared for the attribute drain. Plan to cast it in a special room that lowers spell costs, and on Silvernight
or Darknight, if possible, according to alignment. <big>Note that teleporting no longer interrupts reading, making learning Wish a bit easier.</big><p>

<h4 id="0514">0.5.1.4 Other spells</h4>
Bless damages undead. Healing spells can be cast at monsters including companions (but don't use them on slaves!). Lightning, Magic Missile, Stun Ray and Death Ray bolts will
bounce off the walls, but not doors. Nothing is resistant to a Magic Missile. Magic Lock will close and lock a door in one turn. Anywhere Earthquake generates rocks will be
turned into a normal ground tile &ndash; this can be used to destroy water tiles and make them passable. Some spell durations stack. Bless, Strength of Atlas, Invisibility and
Farsight all stack. Calm Monster doesn't work on monsters generated in tension rooms, threat rooms and vaults. It just results in "The [monster] ignores your spell". In addition,
Arena opponents and Keethrax' animals won't be affected by the Calm Monster spell. <big>Mystic Shovel damages stone monsters.</big> Scare Monster is only effective against humanoids,
animals, and all unclassified monsters except wall beasts.<p>

<b>Book charges</b><br>
Books start with 2d3 charges and disappear when it reaches 0. The number charges left is hidden to the player. Successfully reading a book deducts one charge.<p>

<b>Learning spells</b><br>
Reading a spellbook takes 3 + Cost turns, succeed or fail. "Shelves of books" room effect halves this time. There are 11 possible bonuses to learning a spell:<p>
<ol>
<li>We start off with class. Priests and Wizards have +30, Mindcrafters -40, other classes in between; see "Base" in the table above.
<li>Learning is counted in next; +1/8*Le for Barbarians, +3*Le for Wizards, Necromancers, Elementalists, and in between for others; see "Le mod" in the table above.
<li>Next comes the difficulty based on the specific spellbook (Darkness and Light are lowest with +6, Wish is highest -100).
<li>Pure spellcasters (except Elementalists) attempting to learn purely arcane spells get -10, other combinations get +10.
<li>You are penalized -1 per remaining turn of drunkenness.
<li>You are rewarded +20 for a blessed book and penalized -20 for cursed.
<li>You are rewarded for your level. Pure spellcasters (Druids, Priests, Wizards, Necromancers, and Elementalists) get +Min(75,2*level). All other non-Mindcrafter
non-Trolls get +1*level. Mindcrafters and Troll non-casters get nothing.
<li>+Concentration/5.
<li>+Literacy/10.
<li>Druids and Necromancers receive +40 for their specific starting book, lightning bolt and frost bolt, respectively.
<li>Characters born under Book receive +20.
</ol><p>

All of this combines together for some kind of BaseValue. Now you choose whether to cast or read the book. If you read it, there's a
straight up Literacy roll. Basically, your Literacy skill is a percentage chance of successfully reading the book. If you
fail the check, you "cannot decipher the runes" and nothing else happens (even with 100 Literacy there is 1% chance of automatic failure).
Now if BaseValue &gt; 1d100 you succeed in learning the spell. Otherwise, you fail. SuccessMargin = BaseValue-1d100 previously rolled.<p>

<b>On success</b><br>
You gain castings and train Learning. Learning training is 2*Cost, or Cost/2 if you had some castings already.<p>
If ExistingCastings &lt; 30, then CastingsGained = Min(200 + Le*4, Max(20, Max(5, SuccessMargin - ExistingCastings) * Max(1, Le/4)));
else CastingsGained = Max(5, Max(1, Le/8) * SuccessMargin).<p>

CastingsGained is then reduced by ExistingCastings and level - CastingsGained *= (100 - 3 * (ExistingCastings/50 + lvl/3)) / 100.
Reduction is never worse than 25% of previous value and never reduces CastingsGained below 1.<p>

Next, Cup is +20% CastingsGained, Good and Great Book Learner talents are each +10%.<p>

<b>On failure</b><br>
If you fail to read the book successfully, it depends on SuccessMargin (negative in this case) plus a Failure
value for each class your chances of the book doing something nasty versus your chances to just not learning anything.
See "Failure" in the table above.<p>

If the value is now positive, nothing happens. Otherwise, you get a random penalty from the 11 equally probable effects:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Failed spellbook reading</caption>
<tr><th>#<th>Message<th>Effect
<tr><td>1<td>The spellbook is suddenly gone! <td rowspan=2>spellbook disappears
<tr><td>2<td>The spellbook bursts into flames and is destroyed!

</table><p>

[1] If you're standing on a grave, it'll dig the grave. Gravedigging is always a chaotic act though, even when done in this way.<p>

<b>Summary</b><br>
To sum up, chance of successfuly learning a spell predominantly depends on class (pretty self explanatory to the extent
spellcasters read better). Also birthsign (Book helps), whether you're drunk, the difficulty of the spellbook, whether you're a Mindcrafter/Troll,
B/U/C status of the spellbook, Learning, Concentration, Literacy, and experience level factor in &ndash; the higher of these the better.<p>

<h4 id="0516">0.5.1.6 Spell list</h4>
Notation for spells:<p>
<ul>
<li>W &ndash; Willpower of the PC
<li>M &ndash; Mana of the PC
<li>L &ndash; Level of the PC
<li>P &ndash; Spell Power for the given spell
<li>R &ndash; Maximum range (as determined by the range formula)
<li>R* &ndash; Remaining range points when target is hit
<li>M{x, y} &ndash; take the maximum of x and y
<li>m{x, y} &ndash; take the minimum of x and y
<li>B{l, V, h} &ndash; value V, but minimum l and maximum h
</ul><p>

For Darkness, Light, and ball spells, "Range" means "Radius". Chance is relative probability of a spellbook to be generated. It also hints at spell difficulty.<p>

<h4 id="052">0.5.2 Writing scrolls</h4>
Scrolls can be written if the PC is literate, has seen an example of the scroll, has a magical writing set and a blank scroll to write on. The player uses the set, along with
a blank scroll, and is given the option to specify a type of scroll to create, which must be one that the PC has identified. If the attempt is successful, the result is a scroll
of the player's choosing, possibly coupled with the loss of power points, hit points, and the Mana attribute.<p>

Blank scrolls can be found in the dungeons (usually an unlabeled scroll, although this is not guaranteed), or they can be created by dipping other scrolls into <i>normal</i> water
&ndash; not holy water or unholy water. Be aware that the cost for writing scrolls of corruption removal is high &ndash; there is a permanent loss of two or three Mana points for
<i>Wizards</i>, apparently depending on the B/U/C status of the magical writing set and the blank scroll. The Mana cost for non-Wizards is significantly higher, ten Mana points is
typical. In addition, any combination of a blessed MWS with an uncursed blank scroll or an uncursed MWS with a blessed or uncursed blank scroll will result in a loss of hitpoints.
This loss range from 70 to 145 HP with an experience level one Wizard PC. The HP loss may go down with increasing experience level for Wizards. The HP consequences for non-Wizards
may be more dramatic (ie. deadly).<p>

Writing other scrolls does not have such drastic consequences. Scrolls which are particularly hard to write (in order of decreasing difficulty) include: scroll of corruption removal
(10 Mana cost), scroll of education (7), scroll of protection/defense (6), scroll of increase melee accuracy/damage (5), scroll of item creation (4), crumpled scroll (3). Monks don't
lose Mana when creating scrolls, but they do lose PP and HP as normal. Wizards, Priests and Necromancers have the Mana cost significantly reduced.<p>
<ul>
<li>Using blessed equipment reduces the cost (both scroll and writing set). Cursed equipment increases it.
<li>If Literacy &lt; 1d130 the cost is increased; later you need to pass a straight Literacy roll to succeed at writing at all.
<li>Wizards get a difficulty reduction here (halved, before scroll type is factored in).
<li>Monks don't suffer the negative effects of writing a difficult scroll like other classes do. Wizards and Priests suffer the effects less than others (/2, /4).
<li>Writing scrolls costs PP, and if your PP is too low you'll take damage.
<li>It is not possible to make copies of artifact scrolls.
</ul><p>

<h4 id="053">0.5.3 Mindcraft</h4>
<a href="adomman-M.html">ADOM Manual</a> has a section describing Mindcraft, containing descriptions, formulaes and level availibilities for all Mindcraft powers.<p>

Mindcraft is the unique power of the Mindcrafter. Although it appears similar to spellcasting, it is in fact an entirely different discipline; whereas wizardry is devoted to arcane
power brought out by long study, mindcrafting focuses on drawing out the inherent capabilities of the brain to link with other brains, creating force blasts, reinforcing one's body
and even translocating beings. As such, it behaves differently to normal magic. Mindcraft does not require any equivalent of "spell knowledge" to be invoked. Its powers may be used
an unlimited number of times. Unlike spells, Mindcraft powers cannot be fueled by HP when possessing insufficient PP.<p>

<h4 id="0531">0.5.3.1 Confusion Blast</h4>
Note that Confusion Blast, available to experience level one Mindcrafters, works analoguously to Ventriloquism (section <a href="adomgb-0-4.html">0.4</a>).
It confuses a monster who then does not alert other monsters on the level. It has a range of 3 + (Willpower + Level) / 8 tiles. If it hits an undead monster,
the Mindcrafter takes 4d4 damage (4d4/2 at level 50) and no further effect. Mindless monsters, including insects and the Eternal Guardian, are immune, as are all constructs.
Corrupting monsters will corrupt the PC as for a single melee hit (divided by 4 at level 32); however they <i>are</i> affected normally. The monster will not be affected
if it passes a spell resistance save with an attack power of Level. If it is affected, it will be confused for Level + 1dWi-1 turns.<p>

[1] Monsters undetectable with Eyes of the Mind: green slime, green blob, all statues, all golems, steel zombie, steel horror, animated armor, zombie.<p>

Type of power:<p>
<ul>
<li>TP &ndash; Telepathic &ndash; these powers go through walls and doors, and ignore DV and PV, but do not work on the mindless creatures, constructs or undead.
Linking with undead brains damages the Mincrafter, while corrupted minds transfer some of their corruption. Corrupted beings are 
still telepathically damaged or confused. Corrupted beings that are immune to the power (mindless or immune to confusion) will not corrupt the Mindcrafter.
These powers are subject to spell resistance.<p>

Monsters unaffected by TP powers: all constructs, all undead, all plants, all jellies except for gelatinous cube and gibbering mouther, all insects except for
ankheg, giant bee queen, giant bee warrior, and giant ant queen, bulette, carrion crawler, chaos spawn, Dorn Beast, hydra, moloch, rabid dog, swamp hydra, all worms.<p>

<li>TK &ndash; Telekinetic &ndash; these powers like project a bolt of force energy that acts like physical attack, which never misses but is reduced by
target's PV. Thus it can be used on all enemies (except monsters who can pass through walls, such as ghosts and shadows) without any psychic backslash from undead or
corruption from chaos creatures.<p>

<li>S &ndash; Sustained &ndash; these powers enhance the Mindcrafter as long as they are active. Such abilities will continuously deplete power points
while active but can be turned on and off at will.<p>   

</ul><p>
