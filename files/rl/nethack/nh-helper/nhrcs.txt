    NHRCS - Nethack Random Character Selector (Shell Version 1.0)
    
    Usage:  nhrcs  base-selection-set  [selections... | options...]
   
    Base selection set:
      ALL    Start with all possible character combination; restrict
             the selection set by subsequent '-' selections.
      NONE   Start with an empty set of character combinations, add
             to the selection set by subsequent '+' selections.
      BASE=filename
             Start the selection set using the character combinations
             defined in the given file; you may build your own list
             from the data produced by this program running with the
             options "ALL list" or any subset by specifying selections.
   
    Selections:
      +|- class, +|- race, +|- alignment, +|- gender
             You may specify a sequence of these selections to be added
             (+) or removed (-) from the base selection set. You may
             define compound (class-race-alignment-gender) selections
             (or subsets) by joining the selections with a dash. Missing
             components in the middle must be specified by a '*', as in
             +arc-*-*-fem.
   
    Options:
      All these options may be specified in the ressource file.
   
      name=charactername   Specify the name of your character.
      show      Display the command as it would be executed.
      exec      Launch Nethack with a random selection from your set.
      confirm   Launch Nethack with that selection after confirmation.
      list      Display a list of all possible selections in your set.
   
   
    Examples:
      nhrcs ALL list
        list all combinations of class, race, alignment, and gender,
        which are allowed by Nethack
   
      nhrcs NONE +wiz list
        list all combinations for the wizard class which are allowed
        by Nethack
   
      nhrcs NONE +ran +wiz -hum
        just non-human rangers or wizards
    
      nhrcs NONE +hum
        just humans
    
      nhrcs ALL -rog -mal
        all but rogues or males
    
      nhrcs ALL -wiz-elf -wiz-orc
        all but elven or orcish wizards
    
      nhrcs NONE +rog +wiz +wiz +wiz
        just rogues and wizards, biased towards wizards
    
      Note: You may specify Kornshell's regular expressions in your
      selection:
    
      nhrcs NONE +ran-@(gno|orc)-*-mal
        just male gnomish or orcish rangers of any alignment
    
      Note: If you specify compound selections, like 'tou-hum-neu-mal',
      or 'hum-neu', make sure that the sequence of selectors is in the
      correct order and contiguous.
      
      Note: The charater selection set is build incrementally, so the
      order of single selections is significant, swapping may change the
      result. This is helpful to include otherwise excluded character
      types. Example:
   
          nhrcs NONE +ran +wiz +pri -hum
   
      will select all rangers, wizards, and priests, but never humans;
   
          nhrcs NONE +ran +wiz -hum +pri
   
      will select all rangers and wizards that are non-human, and also
      priests, even human ones.
    
    Files
      .nhrcsrc may contain options which are considered if they are not
      overwritten by options specified on the command line.
    
      Note: If you want to also specify the base selection set as the
      first line in the ressource file use this call syntax to achieve
      it:
          nhrcs $(< ~/.nhrcsrc)
    
    Known bugs:
      Wrong wording for a female caveman (cavewoman) and a female priest
      (priestess).
