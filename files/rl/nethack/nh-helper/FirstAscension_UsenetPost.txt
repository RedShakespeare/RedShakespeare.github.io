I dare wasting bandwidth - it is my 1st ascension.  I'm just too happy.
Please forgive;  demi-gods are only human, though :-)


        "Goodbye Janis the Demigod ..."
                "So thou thought thou couldst kill me, fool."
                        "I'll be back."


Lost my kingdom at Molochs', and reaching level 1 with the amulet in my
hands, I have had to return down to the mines again ...

1  Janis-K  ascended to demigod-hood  179 [219]        (Nethack 3.1.3)

 What's that ??!  A Knight ?  I never really wanted to play a Knight !
 (Must be one of the games "just let us start for 3 dungeon levels or 4" ...)
 ... and now made my very first ascension with that guy.
 He started lawful, and finished chaotic (got the taste of life).

Some specials (at least for me) in this game:
 No cursed bell trick;  no wish for artifact;  got artifact weapons only
 from offering;  no extra altar in the whole game, only minetown (aligned),
 death valley, Orcus' town, Molochs sanctum;  found and ignored Demonbane;
 had two AoLS and did not need them;  had and lost RoReg, RoC, RoID, and
 many good wands, to a "chest attack" in Vlads tower;  besides THE WoW, I
 only found one magic lamp;  got teleport control prior to teleport.

 The most remarkable, however, was:
   MY KNIGHT HAS NO SERIOUS STUPID MOVE DONE  (OK, he'd be dead, otherwise :-)
   (But "YASD" is always my major enemy in the game !!!)
 Some small mistakes could not be avoided:
   a fall in the moat once, but reached the shore alife, and
   the lost of many good items (rings and ray wands) to an electric chest
 And one major one - so that I thought, my adventurer will fail again:
   I deposit my blessed bag of holding on Sanctum level to ease the fight,
   and the last thing I have heard of it was "a crunshing sound".

 This mistake made the game more interesting again - I thought, I will not
 survive -, for several reasons:
   I was at Level 50, deep in the dungeons, when it happend;
   all my holy water, and my scrolls of remove curse were in the bag
   (do you know of the effect of an applied cursed unicorn horn);
   about 20 wands of digging (20 more at level 1, to be prepared for the
   earth level), and many ray wands vanished with the bag, so that I have
   to fight the monsters face to face;
   many gold and gems get lost in the bag (that finally will reduce my
   score), along with my second blessed luckstone;
   many teleport scrolls that would have saved my magic power, and some
   potions of speed, that would have given me a move bonus.
 Finally back on level 1 it turned out, that I will need another bag to
 prepare my inventory for the Elemental Planes.  I could not remember
 where some bag lies around in the dungeons; so I decided to go back to
 the gnomish mines - The Amulet in my pack - full of dread.  Until my
 Knight has been reaching the mine town, nothing approppriate has been
 found.  In a hardware store (after purging the shopkeaper), I decided
 to use my only wand of polymorph for a desperate polypile try - the
 first and only in that game.  After four zaps, the Knight managed to
 get a bag (which finally turned out to be an oilskin sack), and, with
 a bit relief, he hopefully returned to level 1, to collect most stuff.
 For my pickaxe has become cursed, I left back many more gems and gold,
 to take all wands of digging with me.

 The Elemental Planes were no major problem; I only trembled in the Air
 Plane: a Ki-Rin tries to extinguish my Knight, which hardly survived,
 and second: a mind flayer approaches, and no magic portal to find. (My
 last two deaths have been caused by them, so I was heavily frightend !)
 But with ONE foot distance, a portal took me away.  In the Water Plane
 the Wizard made a poor try to steal the Amulet; but where should he go
 to ?  The Astral Plane should not be a problem with my helm of opposite
 alignment; and yet the first altar was mine.

The final data:
 HP:173 [219]  AC:-22  STR:25 (18/65)  DEX:12  CON:18  INT:10  WIS:18  CHR:18
               EXP:25     Moves:81025     mostly burdened, sometimes stressed
Intrinsics:

 very fast, stealthy, aggravate monster,
 poison/fire/cold/shock/sleep/disintegration/hallucination resistent,
 life saved (not needed), protected, reflection,

 extreemly lucky, extra luck, no good/bad luck timeout
