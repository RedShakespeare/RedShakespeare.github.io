<b>5.  How do I uncurse items?</b>

Uncursing items can be a problem.  If you are the devote of some god, the
god will uncurse an item for you occasionally.  To get your god to
uncurse something, first you have to do something for your god.  When
you go to pray to your god, what options are you offered?  Which of
them might make the god disposed to give you a blessing?

It's also possible to get rid of cursed items by bashing them, but
this destroys the object.  Sometimes you want to destroy it, but
sometimes, like with demonhide armor, you still want to use the object
afterwards; you just don't want it to be cursed.

In older versions of the game, the paladins automatically uncurse
anything you're wearing each time you visit them (if you're a paladin,
of course), but in newer versions, this feature has been removed.
