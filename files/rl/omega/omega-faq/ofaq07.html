<b>7.  How do I recharge my mana?</b>

The Sorcerers will do it for a fee, but if you cast a lot of spells,
that can use up mana quickly.  Your mana recharges every time you go
up a level, of course.  There's also a trick you can work with mana-
drain traps where they overload and recharge your mana, but you often
have to step on the same mana-drain trap over and over again -- 30
times or so.  There are also powtabs and the wish for Power.  If you
are a druid, the ritual of neutralization will recharge your mana
(but, ironically enough, if you're a druid, your spells aren't that
nifty, so you don't need the mana as much....)  There are also some
artifacts that recharge your mana; I'll let you discover them for
yourself.
