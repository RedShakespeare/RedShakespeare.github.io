<b>9.  Where is the Archmage's Castle?</b>

The Archmage's Castle lies to the far northwest.  You'll have to
search for it once you're in the right area, just as you did to find
the Goblin Caves.  (Um, you HAVE gone to the Goblin Caves already,
haven't you?  You're probably not ready for the Archmage's Castle
unless you have.)
