<b>12.  Some monsters ignore my attack -- what do I do?</b>

There are several possible strategies for fighting monsters that are
invulnerable to normal damage:

<b>a.</b>  Some weapons will hit monsters that are invulnerable to attack by
normal weapons, and some weapons do more than just physical damage.  A
mace of disruption (which the paladins will give you if you advance
far enough in their guild, and which you can sometimes find just lying
around) will hit any creature, even the ones that normal weapons won't
touch.  A lightsabre, an acid whip, and Demonblade will also hit
invulnerable monsters.  (Be careful of Demonblade, though -- it's
cursed, and it makes you berserk.)  A firestar won't *hit*
invulnerable monsters, but it will blast them with a fireball, which
usually damages them.  There are some weapons that are special and
LOOK as if they'd hit invulnerable monsters but do not actually do so.
The vorpal sword, Victrix, Defender, Goblin's Hewer, scythe of
slicing, and giant club all fall into this category -- they look
special, and some of them do special things, but they do NOT hit
invulnerable monsters.

<b>b.</b>  Use a wand or scroll or spell of dispell -- it'll make the
critters vulnerable to normal physical damage, and then you can hit
them with your regular weapons.  

<b>c.</b>  Attack them with wands or spells of fire or cold or whatever.
Most monsters that can't be hit with a normal weapon are vulnerable to
wand or spell damage.  If fire doesn't work, try cold.  If cold
doesn't work, try disruption.  Many monsters are invulnerable to one
thing, like cold, but not invulnerable to other stuff, like fire or
disruption.  Another advantage to this method is that you can attack
from  a distance, so you can kill that astral vampire when you first
detect him, before he has time to drain all your mana.
