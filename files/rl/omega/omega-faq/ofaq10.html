<b>10.  How do I become more Lawful or more Chaotic?</b>

There is at least one place in Rampart that will give you the
opportunity to become more Lawful, and there is at least one place in
Rampart that will give you the opportunity to become more Chaotic.
Look at the places in Rampart -- what would a good person do?  What
would a bad person do?

Once you've left Rampart, you'll have ample opportunities to alter
your alignment.  It's easy, in these sorts of games, to fall into the
mindset that monsters are for killing, but think about it for a second
-- does a Lawful person really attack anything that hasn't attacked
him or her first?  What other things might a Lawful person do -- might
they not try to reform the monsters somehow?  As for a Chaotic person,
it's easy to see that they would kill anything that moves, if it would
be to their advantage, without regard for whether the monster was
hostile or not.  But there's another, even more Chaotic thing that you
can do with monsters.  Think of something sneaky that you could do to
betray a monster....

The Archdruid will conduct the ritual of neutralization if you ask him
to.  If you are a Druid, this makes your alignment completely neutral.
If you are not a Druid, the effect is somewhat different.  In the most
recent version of the game, the ritual will bring your alignment back
TOWARDS Neutral -- the less experienced you are, the more nearly
Neutral you become.  If you are a very advanced character, it doesn't
work at all.  In previous versions of the game, the ritual always
accomplished complete neutralization, so if you're used to the older
version, be aware that it doesn't work that way anymore....
