<b>3.  Which order should I do things in?</b>

If you visit the Oracle, she will give you excellent advice about what
order you should do things in.  The Duke, who lives in the castle,
will also send you on quests if you present yourself to him.  His
quests and the Oracle's advice usually overlap, but if they disagree,
well, the Duke is just a secular authority, but the Oracle's whole job
is being wise....
