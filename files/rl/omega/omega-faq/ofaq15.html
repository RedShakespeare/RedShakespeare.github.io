<b>15.  How do I win the Adept's Challenge?  How do I completely destroy
Death?</b>

The game itself gives you three hints about the Adept's Challenge,
which are all that should be necessary for you to figure out what to
do and how to win.  To get these three hints, make sure you step on
every square of the area where the Challenge takes place (except the
ones that have stuff on them).  The area where the Challenge takes
place isn't all that big, so it doesn't take too long to explore it
completely.  Step on every square and listen to the three things it
tells you.

As it turns out, it isn't necessary to completely destroy Death to win
the Adept's Challenge.  If you've been waiting to finish up until you
completely destroy Death, you'll wait a loooong time.  You only have
to kill Death once, to get the item he carries, and then you're ready.
Of course, killing Death is good experience, so you might enjoy just
hanging out and killing him over and over again, but once is all
that's necessary.
