<b>8.  How do I find the Archdruid?  </b>

The Archdruid is in a temple north of the city.  Follow the road
northeast until you come to a village.  (You don't need to enter the

village, and you should find the temple, which is denoted by an X.
Once inside the temple, you'll need to explore it rather thoroughly in
order to find the Archdruid.  Search some likely-looking areas....
