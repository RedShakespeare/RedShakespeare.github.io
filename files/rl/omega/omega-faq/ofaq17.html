<b>17.  One final piece of advice:</b>

A lot of the fun of Omega is discovering things.  There are a lot of
cute little tricks in the game, and it's much more fun to discover
them than to read about them.  So, my advice is to find out most of
the things about Omega through play, rather than through spoilers.
Ask for a hint if you get really stuck, but don't ask too early or as
a result of general policy.  After all, would you rather read a novel
about your life, or would you rather LIVE it? :-)


Good luck, and have fun!
