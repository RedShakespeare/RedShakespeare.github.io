<b>6.  How do I get items identified?</b>

If you have the spell of identify, you can do it yourself.  You can
get the spell by praying to Athena (who specializes in wisdom, you'll
recall) or by belonging to the Collegium Magi and advancing once.

You can also get the thieves' guild to identify things for you.
They'll identify items for the general public at a fee of 50AU per
item.  If you're a thief, however, the fee is only 5AU.

Identifying items is useful enough that you should probably consider
becoming a devote of Athena or a mage or a thief as your first or
second guild.
