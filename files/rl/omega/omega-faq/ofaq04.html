<a name="a"><b>4.  a.  What is the Oracle?  </b></a>

The Oracle is a wise person who resides in Rampart and gives advice to
adventurers. 

<a name="b">    <b>b.  How do I find the Oracle?</b></a>

Since the Oracle is a special and magical person, she doesn't live in
an ordinary house in an ordinary part of town.  Seek her where Rampart
is wilder.

<a name="v">    <b>c.  Why do I want to find the Oracle, anyway?</b></a>

There are a couple of reasons for finding the Oracle.  The game is
lots easier if you do things in the order the Oracle tells you, rather
than just randomly wandering around.  The Oracle's initial advice is
especially valuable, since she sends you on a quest that is not very
dangerous but which will advance you from level one to level three.
This means that you will have more hit points and more mana and more
experience to take on the next, more dangerous, quest.

Another reason for finding the Oracle is that there is a place that
you will eventually need to visit that is only reachable via the
Oracle.  She will send you to this place when you are ready.
