<b>11.  How do I keep from being slowed by monsters?</b>

Some monsters will reduce your speed, so that you get fewer attacks
and move more slowly in general.  Goblin shamans (found in the lower
levels of the Goblin Cave) often do this, and necromancers (found
around levels 3-5 of the Archmage's Castle) do it, too.  Preventing
slowness is much easier than curing slowness, though both can be done.
To keep from being slowed, you need immunity to slowness, which will
show up on your stats (when you use a ring of knowledge or look in the
Oracle's mirror) as "Hasted."  You get hasted by taking a stimtab or
by casting the spell of haste on yourself or by wearing boots of
speed.  Doing these things won't CURE slowness -- they'll only PREVENT
slowness, so you have to do them before you start fighting the goblin
shamans or the necromancers or whatever.  To cure slowness, you can
either wait a really long time, or you can rent a condo for a week of
rest and relaxation.
