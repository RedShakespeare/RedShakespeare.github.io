<b>16.  How do I enter Wizard mode?</b>

Go to the northwest corner of Rampart and bash the wall.  You'll feel
like a cheater. :-)  Entering Wizard mode will invalidate your score
but will enable you to wish for anything you want (including specific
objects, unlike the spell of wishing).  This enables you to test out
spells or objects or strategies.  Be careful, though -- having
infinite power with no limits actually gets stale awfully fast, so
Wizard mode isn't fun for very long.  And after you've been in Wizard
mode, it's hard to get used to regular Omega again.  I'd recommend
that you not enter Wizard mode without a specific reason.  If all you
want to do is try something out without getting your character killed,
just copy the file....
