<a name="a"><b>2.  a.  How should I begin the game?</b></a>

The guilds are the key to success in Omega, and joining a guild should
be your first action upon beginning a game.  You want all of the
experience you get to count towards advancement in your guild, so you
should join a guild before you disarm your first trap or kill your
first monster or go on the Oracle's first quest.

Some guilds require that you be of a particular alignment in order to
join, and you will need to do one or two things before joining the
guild in order to become of the appropriate alignment.  Notice,
though, that there is something you can do in Rampart that will make
you slightly Lawful (Lawful enough to join any of the Lawful guilds),
and there is something in Rampart you can do to make you slightly
Chaotic (Chaotic enough to join any of the Chaotic guilds), so you
needn't leave Rampart before you join a guild.

In addition to joining a guild, you'll need to obtain some basic
equipment, if your guild doesn't provide you with any (some guilds do,
and some don't, so don't buy anything before you've joined your
guild).  You should have some sort of weapon and some sort of armor --
there's an armorer in Rampart who will sell these to you.  You should
also have a little bit of food on hand when you leave Rampart, in case
you need to eat on your journey -- there's a fast food restaurant in
Rampart that will sell you food.  It's also nice to check out the pawn
shop from time to time and see if they have anything you can't live
without.

<a name="b">    <b>b.  Which guild should I join?</b></a>

Each player has his or her own favorite guild.  The game is set up so
that each guild gives you something good, so all of them are worthy
(with the possible exception of being a priest of Destiny).  Which
guild you pick really depends on what kinds of things you like to do
and how you like to play.  And part of the fun of Omega is that you
can join one set of guilds this time and a different set of guilds the
next time you play, so your game doesn't get stale.

All of the gods except Destiny give their adherents spells and will
occasionally remove cursed items for you.  The god will also sometimes
throw snowballs at monsters that are attacking you.  When you advance
to the highest level, you get a holy symbol that recharges your mana.
You must have the same alignment as your god (Lawful, Neutral, or
Chaotic), and you must be of the right alignment every time you pray
to your god.  Unlike the sorcerers and the paladins, though, you are
not required to become more lawful or more chaotic in order to advance.

The collegium magi gives you lots of spells, and every time you
research a new spell, you get experience for it.  Unfortunately,
sometimes spell research is unsuccessful.  You must pay tuition unless
you have an intelligence of 18.  Alignment is unimportant.

The sorcerers also give you spells, but not nearly as many as the
collegium magi does.  You can join them no matter what your alignment
is, but you must be Chaotic in order to advance, and your alignment
must become progressively more chaotic in order to advance to higher
levels.  There is a fee required to join the guild -- the higher your
Power is, the lower the fee is.

The thieves' guild requires that you be Neutral or Chaotic when you
join, but they don't care what you are after that.  They'll identify
stuff for you, buy stuff at better rates than the pawnshop, and give
you an occasional spell.  You can pickpocket other creatures and open
locks with a lockpick.  One must pay dues in order to join; the higher
your Dexterity, the lower the dues.

The mercenaries give you lots of cash and not much else.  They start
you off with a basic weapon and armor, but you don't get any niftier
equipment upon advancement.  Money is versatile, though -- you can
buy equipment or you can buy time at the gym to boost your stats or
you can buy spell research at the collegium magi.  Some of us find
money to be rather a yawn, though.

The paladins give you equipment and a horse.  Every time you return to
their headquarters, they feed you and cure you of any wounds or
diseases you may have.  In older versions of the game, they also
remove the curse on any cursed items you're carrying, but in later
versions of the game, this feature has been removed.  At later levels,
the paladins also give you a spell or two.  The paladins' mace of
disruption, which you get when you advance enough in their guild, is
one of those rare weapons that will hit even those monsters that
aren't subject to normal weapons.  You must be Lawful to join the
order of paladins, and you must become progressively more Lawful in
order to advance.

The arena gives you free time at the gym, which boosts your stats, one
basic (not very good) weapon, and cash every time you win a fight.
They also give you an extra maneuver (attack or defense), which is
very useful, especially at low levels.  If you advance to the highest
level, you win Victrix, a very nifty weapon that has a high to-hit and
also makes you immune to fear.  You must have reasonable physical
stats in order to join the arena, but alignment is unimportant.

Most guilds raise one or more of your stats every time you advance.
For example, the collegium raises your intelligence and power, the
mercenaries raise your strength and constitution, and so forth.  The
arena doesn't do this, but it does give you time at the gym, which
accomplishes the same thing.

So, if you like to cast spells, you should pray to a god or join the
collegium magi or the sorcerers.  If you'd prefer to hack and slash,
then you should join the mercenaries or the paladins or the arena.
Which guild you join may be limited by what your stats are or by
whether you can afford tuition or dues or whatever.

If you STILL don't know which guild to join, then join the paladins.
They take care of you, by feeding you and curing disease and whatnot,
so they're good for a new player who doesn't yet know how to avoid
becoming diseased or how to avoid some of the other nasty things that
the paladins will take care of for you.  (This is especially true of
older versions of the game, where the paladins remove curses on cursed
items.)  But remember that you'll have to be VERY Lawful.

It is possible to join more than one guild at once, although there are
some guilds that don't work together.  For example, you can't belong
to the arena or the mercenaries and also be a paladin.  You can't be a
sorcerer and also a member of the collegium magi.  When you belong to
more than one guild, any experience you gain is split among those
guilds (with the exception of the arena, where you only advance by
fighting in the arena).  This means that the more guilds you belong
to, the more slowly you advance in all of them.  Hence, low-level
characters should probably stick to a single guild (or a single guild
plus the arena, if your guild accepts arena members).  Once you've
advanced as far as you can go in your guild without completing the
final guildquest, then it's time to join a second guild.

Now is the time for you to consult the Oracle for advice about what to
do next.
