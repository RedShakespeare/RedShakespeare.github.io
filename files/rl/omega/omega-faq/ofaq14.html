<b>14.  How do I find the Adept's Challenge?</b>

If you are a member of the collegium magi or have acquired the spell
of ritual magic in some other way, you can reach the Adept's Challenge
by casting ritual magic in the appropriate room.  Which room LOOKS
like it would send you to the Adept's Challenge if you cast ritual
magic there?

If you have the spell of wishing, you can wish for Location and then
ask to be transported to the Temple of Destiny.

If you have the Amulet of the Planes, you can use it to transport you
to the Temple of Destiny.

If you don't have any of these things, you might not be ready to try
the Adept's Challenge after all.  If you want to do it anyway, then
you'll have to hoof it to the Temple of Destiny, which is in a rather
inaccessible location....
