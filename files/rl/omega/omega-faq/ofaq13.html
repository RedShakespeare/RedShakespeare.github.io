<b>13.  What do I do with the Orbs?</b>

You'll sometimes find an Orb lying around in the goblin caves or the
sewers or the Archmage's castle, but the usual place to find the Orbs
is on the Astral Plane.  When you go to the Astral Plane, you should
get FIVE Orbs: the Orb of Water, the Orb of Earth, the Orb of Air, the
Orb of Fire, and the Orb of Mastery.  It's kinda hard to get back to
the Astral Plane once you've left, so make sure you pick up all five
of them while you're there.  If you find an Orb somewhere not on the
Astral Plane, it's probably okay to activate it.  If you find an Orb
in the Astral Plane, though, you should hang onto it.  The reason for
this is that you can only activate the Orb of Mastery if you have the
other four Orbs (on your person, not in your backpack).  Activating
the Orb of Mastery will burn out all four of the other Orbs.

Orbs are artifacts and are activated in the same way that you would
activate any other artifact.  After you've activated it, you will be
asked to choose an action from a list -- which action you should
choose will be obvious.  Then you will be asked for a target.
Whatever you choose is about to get blasted, so you shouldn't choose
the square where you're standing!

Oh, and you might want to show the Orb of Mastery to the Duke before
you activate it....

While we're talking about the Astral Plane, please note that there is
a bug in the game such that if you save the game while you're on the
Astral Plane and then restore it, the Star Gem will be gone.  This
means that you should only go to the Astral Plane when you have enough
time to play all six levels in one sitting.
