<p>"It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature." </p>

<p>omega is not just a large program, it is a large, complicated, and not
particularly well written program. There are so many features that not
all can be well tested, particularly in combination with one another.
Therefore, it is likely that your version, whatever it is, has some
bugs. The author no longer strives to correct bugs and remedy
misfeatures, so you probably shouldn't send mail to
brothers@paul.rutgers.edu.  However, if you send such mail to
omega@alcyone.darkside.com (Erik Max Francis), there may be attempts
to remedy the problem - don't hold your breath, though.</p>
