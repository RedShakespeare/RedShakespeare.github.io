==================== </b></pre></font></center>
<p>Since omega's dungeon is quite large, only the current dungeon and
the city level will be saved; other dungeons you may have entered
previously will be regenerated as you re-enter them. If you know the
spell of <i>Return</i>, however, (learnable at the <i>Explorers' Club</i>) you will
be able to warp to your deepest excursion in any dungeon without
having to retraverse the old levels in between. Some other shortcuts
exist for "warping" from one locale or level to another.</p>

<p>Games can be restored by giving the save file as a command line argument
as in:</p>

<pre>% omega quasar.sav</pre>

<p>To at least simulate the continuity of character in the game, saved
files will be unlinked on restoration. Of course, you *<b>can</b>* copy them.</p>

<p>Save files are automatically compressed unless the flag
<i>COMPRESS_SAVE_FILES</i> is undefined in odefs.h. This doubles the amount
of time taken to save, but reduces the typical save file by a factor
of more than 10.  If you feel that the wait is too long, and have space
to burn, you can turn off save-file compression in the Options menu.</p>
