<p>Your character may be taught spells by his or her guild or priesthood,
at the <i>collegium magii</i>, by <i>the sorceror's guild</i>, or pick them up from
a scroll of spells. Every spell costs some amount of mana to cast.
Mana is not normally regenerated except when the player goes up an
experience level, but various magic items augment mana, and the
sorceror's guild will recharge you for a fee. If you learn the same
spell multiple times, the effective power drain to cast the spell is
lowered. Some spells have a constant effect, while others vary
according to your level.  The spell of <i>ritual magic</i> has a variety of
different effects depending on the circumstances under which it is
cast. The spell of high magic is the most powerful, by the way.</p>
