===============</b></pre></font></center>
<p><i>Rampart</i> is set in a strange landscape of different terrain types. The
land is surrounded in part by a mystic sea of chaos which it is
probably a good idea to avoid. Screen characters have a different
meaning in the countryside than they do elsewhere, by the way, and
there is a different command set (accessible by '<kbd>?</kbd>' when out of the
city). Time passes much more quickly in countryside movement; you will
have to bring a lot of food with you, though you may wish to
hunt ('<kbd>H</kbd>' command) to supplement your food reserves; many of the
animals that you may encounter, for example, are edible.</p>

<p>Since each countryside site is quite a large area, you may have
to search ('<kbd>s</kbd>' command) to learn of interesting sites nearby.</p>

<pre><b>Countryside Map Example:</b>

++----.--- The @ as usual is the player; the +'s are an arm of the Sea of
+++++O--^^ Chaos; the O is the city of Rampart; the ^'s are mountains;
----@----^ the .'s are a road; the -'s are plains and meadows;
---.-^^^^^ and the * is a dungeon entrance.
...-^*^^^^</pre>

<p>The countryside can be rather dangerous for low level characters to
explore at random. However, maps of the surrounding areas can be
purchased at the villages which can be found mostly at the ends
of the roads. Each village has a "special" magical site somewhere
inside its borders. These sites may be beneficial or harmful
depending how they are approached and the circumstances of their
activation.</p>

<p>There are a number of "special" locations in the countryside; these
are basically one-level screens of various sorts, or they may be
multi-level dungeons. If you follow the advice of the oracle
who may be found somewhere in Rampart, you will wind up visiting most
of these sites.</p>

<p>A special site or dungeon may be entered from the Countryside
environment by means of the '<kbd>&gt;</kbd>' command. Depending whether or not it
is a multilevel or single level site, it may be exited simply by
moving off the edge of the screen, or by ascending or descending a
stairway from the first level of the dungeon.</p>
