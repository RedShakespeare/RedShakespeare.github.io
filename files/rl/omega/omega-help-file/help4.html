========</b></pre></font></center>
<p>The mechanics of movement are much like rogue. You can use either the
vi keys (<kbd>hjklbnyu</kbd>) or the numeric keypad to move; the capitalized vi
keys or a keypad direction preceded by a <kbd>5</kbd> "run" in that direction
until either an object is run into, or an "interesting" location is
hit. More locations are "interesting" if the "<i>RUNSTOP</i>" option is set.
In most environments, a single move takes but a few seconds of game
time, depending on the player's "<i>Spd</i>" score, but some places movement
takes longer. In the countryside environment, the scale is much larger
than usual (say 5KM/move), so a single move can take hours. (Riding a
horse can reduce the amount of time taken in the country, depending on
the terrain being travelled). In the city or village environments, the
scale is such that a move takes about 30 seconds or so of gametime.</p>
