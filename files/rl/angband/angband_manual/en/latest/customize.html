<h1>Customising the game<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#customising-the-game" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Angband allows you to change various aspects of the game to suit your tastes.  These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Options - which let you change interface or gameplay behaviour</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#ignoring-items">Ignoring items</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#inscribing-items">inscribing items</a> to change how the game treats them</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#showing-extra-info-in-subwindows">Showing extra info in subwindows</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#keymaps">Keymaps</a> - a way to assign commonly-used actions to specific keys</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#visuals">Visuals</a> - allowing you to change the appearance of in-game entities like objects and monsters</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#colours">Colours</a> - allowing you to make a given color brighter, darker, or even completely different</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#interface-details">Interface details</a> - depending on which interface to the game you use, these give you control over the font, window placement, and graphical tile set</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Except for the options, which are linked to the save file, and interface
details, that are handled by the front end rather than the core of the game,
you can save your preferences for these into files, which are called
<cite>user pref files</cite>.  For the options, customize those using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> command
while playing.</p>
<section id="user-pref-files">
<h2>User Pref Files<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#user-pref-files" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>User pref files are Angband’s way of saving and loading certain settings.  They can store:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Altered visual appearances for game entities</p></li>
<li><p>Inscriptions to automatically apply to items</p></li>
<li><p>Keymaps</p></li>
<li><p>Altered colours</p></li>
<li><p>Subwindow settings</p></li>
<li><p>Colours for different types of messages</p></li>
<li><p>What audio files to play for different types of messages</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are simple text files with an easy to modify format, and the game has a set of pre-existing pref files in the lib/customize/ folder.  It’s recommended you don’t modify these.</p>
<p>Several options menu (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code>) items allow you to load existing user pref files, create new user pref files, or save to a user pref file.</p>
<section id="where-to-find-them">
<h3>Where to find them<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#where-to-find-them" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>On macOS, you can find them in your user directory, in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Documents/Angband/</span></code>.</p>
<p>On Linux, they will be stored in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.angband/Angband</span></code>.</p>
<p>On Windows you can find them in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib/user/</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-they-get-loaded">
<h3>How do they get loaded?<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#how-do-they-get-loaded" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the game starts up, after you have loaded or created a character, some user pref files are loaded automatically.  These are the ones mentioned above in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib/customize/</span></code> folder, namely <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pref.prf</span></code> followed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">font.prf</span></code>.  If you have graphics turned on, then the game will also load some settings from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib/tiles/</span></code>.</p>
<p>After these are complete, the game will try to load (in order):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>race</em>.prf - where <em>race</em> is your character’s race, so something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dwarf.prf</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><em>class</em>.prf - where <em>class</em> is your character’s class, so something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Paladin.prf</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><em>name</em>.prf - where <em>name</em> is your character’s name, so something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Balin.prf</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, you can save some settings - for example, keymaps - to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mage.prf</span></code> file if you only want them to be loaded for mages.</p>
<p>You may also enter single user pref commands directly, using the special “Enter a user pref command” command, activated by pressing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;</span></code>.</p>
<p>You may have to use the redraw command (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^R</span></code>) after changing certain of the aspects of the game to allow Angband to adapt to your changes.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="ignoring-items">
<h2>Ignoring items<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#ignoring-items" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Angband allows you to ignore specific items that you don’t want to see anymore. These items are marked ‘ignored’ and any similar items are hidden from view. The easiest way to ignore an item is with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">k</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^D</span></code>) command; the object is dropped and then hidden from view.  When ignoring an object, you will be given a choice of ignoring just that object, or all objects like it in some way.</p>
<p>The entire ignoring system can also be accessed from the options menu (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code>) by choosing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Item</span> <span class="pre">ignoring</span> <span class="pre">setup</span></code>.  This allows ignore settings for non-wearable items, and quality and ego ignore settings (described below) for wearable items, to be viewed or changed.</p>
<p>There is a quality setting for each wearable item type. Ignoring a wearable item will prompt you with a question about whether you wish to ignore all of that type of item with a certain quality setting, or of an ego type, or both.</p>
<p>The quality settings are:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>bad</dt><dd><p>The weapon/armor has negative AC, to-hit or to-dam.</p>
</dd>
<dt>average</dt><dd><p>The weapon/armor has no pluses no minuses.  It is non-magical.</p>
</dd>
<dt>good</dt><dd><p>The weapon/armor has positive AC, to-hit or to-dam. However it does not
have any special abilities, brands, slays, stat-boosts, resistances</p>
</dd>
<dt>non-artifact</dt><dd><p>This setting only leaves artifacts unignored.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="inscribing-items">
<h2>Inscribing items<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#inscribing-items" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inscriptions are notes you can mark on objects using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{</span></code> command.  You can use this to give the game commands about the object, which are listed below. You can also set up the game to automatically inscribe certain items whenever you find them, using the object knowledge screens, accessed using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Inscribing an item with ‘!!’:</dt><dd><p>This will alert you when the item has finished recharging.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with ‘=g’:</dt><dd><p>This marks an item as ‘always pick up’.  This is sometimes useful for
picking up ammunition after a shootout.  If there is a number
immediately after the ‘g’, then the amount picked up automatically
will be limited.  If you have inscribed a spellbook with ‘=g4’ and have
four or more copies in your pack, you will not automatially pick up
any more copies when you have the ‘pickup if in inventory’ option
enabled.  If you have three copies in your pack with that inscription
and happen to find a pile of two copies, you’ll automatically pick up
one so there is four in the pack.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!</span></code> followed by a command letter or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>:</dt><dd><p>This means “ask me before using this item”.  ‘!w’ means ‘ask me before
wielding’, ‘!d’ means ‘ask me before dropping’, and so on.  If you
inscribe an item with ‘!*’ then the game will confirm any use of an
item.</p>
<p>Say you inscribed your potion of Speed with ‘!q’.  This would prompt
you when you try to drink it to see if you really mean to.  Multiple
‘!q’ inscriptions will prompt multiple times.</p>
<p>Similarly, using !v!k!d makes it very hard for you to accidentally
throw, ignore or put down the item it is inscribed on.</p>
<p>Some adventurers use this for Scrolls of Word of Recall so they don’t
accidentally return to the dungeon too soon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></code>, followed by a command letter, followed by 0-9:</dt><dd><p>Normally when you select an item from your inventory you must enter the
letter that corresponds to the item. Since the order of your inventory
changes as items get added and removed, this can get annoying.  You
can instead assign certain items numbers when using a command so that
wherever they are in your backpack, you can use the same keypresses.
If you have multiple items inscribed with the same thing, the game will
use the first one.</p>
<p>For example, if you inscribe a staff of Cure Light Wounds with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;u1">‘<span>&#64;</span>u1</a>’,
you can refer to it by pressing 1 when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">u</span></code>sing it.  You could also
inscribe a wand of Wonder with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;a1">‘<span>&#64;</span>a1</a>’, and when using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, 1 would select
that wand.</p>
<p>Spellcasters should inscribe their books, so that if they lose them they
do not cast the wrong spell.  If you are mage and the beginner’s
spellbook is the first in your inventory, casting ‘maa’ will cast magic
missile. But if you lose your spellbook, casting ‘maa’ will cast the
first spell in whatever new book is in the top of your inventory. This
can be a waste in the best case scenario and exceedingly dangerous in
the worst! By inscribing your spellbooks with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;m1">‘<span>&#64;</span>m1</a>’, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;m2">‘<span>&#64;</span>m2</a>’, etc., if
you lose your first spellbook and attempt to cast magic missile by
using ‘m1a’, you cannot accidentally select the wrong spellbook.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>, followed by a command letter:</dt><dd><p>When you wear an item inscribed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>, the game prompts you before
doing that action.  You might inscribe ‘^&gt;’ on an item if you want to
be reminded to take it off before going down stairs.  If the item is in
your backpack then the game won’t prompt you.</p>
<p>Like with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!</span></code>, you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> for the command letter if you want to
game to prompt you every turn whatever you’re doing.  This can get
very annoying!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<section id="showing-extra-info-in-subwindows">
<h2>Showing extra info in subwindows<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#showing-extra-info-in-subwindows" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the main window, you can create additional windows that have secondary information on them. You can access the subwindow menu by using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">w</span></code>, where you can choose what to display in which window.</p>
<p>You may then need to make the window visible using the “window” menu from the menu bar (if you have one in your version of the game).</p>
<p>There are a variety of subwindow choices and you should experiment to see which ones are the most useful for you.</p>
</section>
<section id="keymaps">
<h2>Keymaps<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#keymaps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can set up keymaps in Angband, which allow you to map a single keypress, the trigger, to a series of keypresses, the action.  For example you might map the key F1 to “maa” (the keypresses to cast “Magic Missile” as a spellcaster).  This can speed up access to commonly-used features.  To bypass a keymap that’s been assigned to a key, press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code> before pressing the key.</p>
<p>To set up keymaps, go to the options menu (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code>) and select “Edit keymaps” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code>).  There, you can check if a key triggers a keymap:  select “Query a keymap” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>) and then press the key to check.  You can also remove an existing keymap:  select “Remove a keymap” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code>) and then press the key that trigger the keymap to be removed.  To add a new keymap (or overwrite an existing one), select “Create a keymap” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d</span></code>), it will then prompt you for the key that triggers the keymap.  After pressing the trigger key, you’ll be prompted for the keymap’s action, the series of keypresses that’ll be generated when the trigger key is pressed.  If you make a mistake while entering the keypresses for the action, press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Control-u</span></code> to erase the keypresses already entered for the action.  Once you’ve finished entering the keypresses for the action, press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> to end the sequence; you’ll then be prompted for whether to keep the newly entered keymap.</p>
<p>Within the action for a keymap, it is frequently useful to temporarily suppress -more- prompts since they can swallow keypresses from the keymap.  To disable those prompts from within the action, include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(</span></code>.  To reenable the prompts, include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">)</span></code>.  So, a typical action where -more- prompts could happen would look like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(</span></code> your keypresses here <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">)</span></code>.</p>
<p>The keypresses in the action will be interpreted relative to the keyset you are currently using (original or roguelike).  The game will remember what keyset was in effect when the keymap was created.  So if you change keysets, the keymaps which were only defined for the other keyset won’t be visible.  You can have two keymaps, one for the original keyset and another for the roguelike keyset, bound to the same trigger.</p>
<p>Keymaps are not recursive.  If you have F1 as the trigger for a keymap, including F1 as a keypress in the action for that or another keymap won’t invoke that keymap.</p>
<p>Any changes you make to keymaps from the options menu only last as long as the game is running.  To have them affect future sessions, save the keymaps to a file.  There’s an option to do that from the menu for editing keymaps.  See <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#user-pref-files">User Pref Files</a> for how the name of the file affects whether the file is loaded when the game reloads your character.</p>
<p>Note that the game accounts for the modifier keys (Shift, Control, Alt, Meta) that are pressed along with a key.  On most platforms, the game also distinguishes between the keys on the numeric keypad that have equivalents on the main keyboard.  When a keypress is displayed or saved to the preference file, the modifiers, if any, for the keypress are displayed by code letters (S for Shift, ^ for Control, A for Alt, M for Meta, and K for the numeric keypad) within curly braces prior to the keypress.  There are two exceptions to that:  if Control is the only modifier it will displayed as ^ before the keypress without any curly braces and if Shift is the only modifier it will often be folded into the keypress itself.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="n">S</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Control</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Shift</span><span class="o">-&amp;</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="n">AK</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Alt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">the</span> <span class="n">numeric</span> <span class="n">keypad</span>
<span class="o">^</span><span class="n">d</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Control</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">d</span>
<span class="n">A</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Shift</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Special keys, like F1, F2, or Tab, are all written within square brackets [].
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">^</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">F1</span><span class="p">]</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Control</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">F1</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="n">S</span><span class="p">}[</span><span class="n">Tab</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Control</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Shift</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Tab</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Special keys include [Escape].</p>
<p>You may find it easier to edit the preference files directly to change a keymap.  Keymaps are written in pref files as:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">act</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">trigger</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The action must always come first,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`&lt;type&gt;`</span></code> means ‘keyset type’, which is either 0 for the original keyset or 1 for the roguelike keyset.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">act</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">maa</span>
<span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">F1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>An action can have more than one trigger bound to it by having more than
one keymap-input line after it and before the next keymap-act line.  One
reason to do that would be to have the keymap work with either keyset.  For
example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">act</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">maa</span>
<span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">F1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">keymap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">F1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Angband uses a few built-in keymaps.  These are for the movement keys (they are mapped to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">;</span></code> plus the number, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span></code> -&gt; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">;5</span></code>), amongst others.  You can see the full list in pref.prf, but they shouldn’t impact you in any way.</p>
</section>
<section id="colours">
<h2>Colours<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#colours" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The “Interact with colors” options submenu (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>) allows you to change how different colours are displayed.  Depending on what kind of computer you have, this may or may not have any effect.</p>
<p>The interface is quite clunky.  You can move through the colours using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code> for ‘next colour’ and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> for ‘previous colour’.  Then upper and lower case <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">g</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code> will let you tweak the color.  You can then save the results to user pref file.</p>

<h2>Visuals<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#visuals" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can change how various in-game entities are displayed using the visuals editor.  This editor is part of the knowledge menus (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code>).  When you are looking at a particular entity - for example, a monster - if you can edit its visuals, that will be mentioned in the prompt at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>If you are in graphics mode, you will be able to select a new tile for the entity.  If you are not, you will only be able to change its colours.</p>
<p>Once you have made edits, you can save them from the options menu (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code>).  Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v</span></code> for ‘save visuals’ and choose what you want to save.</p>

<h2>Interface details<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#interface-details" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some aspects of how the game is presented, notably the font, window placement
and graphical tile set, are controlled by the front end, rather than the core
of the game itself.  Each front end has its own mechanism for setting those
details and recording them between game sessions.  Below are brief descriptions
for what you can configure with the standard <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#windows">Windows</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#x11">X11</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#sdl">SDL</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#sdl2">SDL2</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#mac">Mac</a> front ends.</p>
<section id="windows">
<h3>Windows<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#windows" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the Windows front end, the game, by default, displays several of the
the subwindows and uses David Gervais’s graphical tiles to display the map.
You can close a subwindow with the standard close control on the window’s
upper right corner.  Closing the main window with the standard control causes
the game to save its current state and then exit.  You can reopen or also
close a subwindow via the “Visibilty” menu, the first entry in the “Window”
menu for the main window.  To move a window, use the standard procedure:
position the mouse pointer on the window’s title bar and then click and drag
the mouse to change the window’s position.  Click and drag on the edges or
corners of a window to change its size.  To select the font for a window, use
the “Font” menu, the second entry in the “Window” menu for the main window.</p>
<p>The “Term Options” entry in the “Window” menu for the main window is a shortcut
to access the core game’s method for selecting the contents of the subwindows.
You can read more about that in <a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#showing-extra-info-in-subwindows">Showing extra info in subwindows</a>.  The
“Reset Layout” will rearrange the windows to conform with the current size and
will have a similar result to what you would get from restarting the Windows
interface without a preset configuration.</p>
<p>The “Bizarre Display” entry in the “Window” menu allows to toggle on or off
an alternate text display algorithm for each window.  That was added for
compatibility with Windows Vista and later.  The default setting, on, should
likely be used, unless text display is garbled on your system and the off
setting allows text to be displayed properly.</p>
<p>The “Increase Tile Width” and “Decrease Tile Width” options in the “Window”,
let you increment or decrement, by one pixel, the width of the columns in a
window.  The “Increase Tile Height” and “Decrease Tile Height” options are
similar but work with the height of the rows.  For the primary window, you
could use the “Term 0 Font Tile Size” entry as an alternative to those to set
the width of the columns and height of the rows to certain combinations or to
match the width and height of the font, which is the default.  When the
“Enable Nice Graphics” option is on (it’s in the “Options” menu for the main
window), the “Increase Tile Width”, “Decrease Tile Width”,
“Increase Tile Height”, “Decrease Tile Height”, and “Term 0 Font Tile Size”
entries will have no effect since the column width and row height are set
automatically when that option is on.</p>
<p>To change whether graphical tiles are used, use the “Graphics” menu, the first
entry in the “Options” menu for the main window.  The “None” option in the
“Graphics” menu will disable graphical tiles and use text for the map.  The
next section section in that menu allows you to select one of the graphical
tile sets.  Turning on the “Enable Nice Graphics” option in the “Graphics”
menu is a shortcut for automatically setting sizes to get a reasonable-looking
result.  When that is turned on or is already on and the tile set is changed,
the width of the columns (“tile width”), height of the rows (“tile height”)
and the number of rows and columns used to display a tile (the
“Tile Multiplier”) will be adjusted to work well with the current font size and
the native size of the graphical tiles.  You can manually adjust the number of
rows and columns used for displaying a tile with the “Tile Multiplier” entry
in the “Graphics” menu.  Since typical fonts are often twice as tall as wide,
multipliers where the first value, for the width, is twice the second, often
x work better with the tiles that are natively square (the original ones,
Adam Bolt’s, David Gervais’s, and the two versions of Shockbolt’s tiles).
Nomad’s tiles are 8 x 16 and so usually work best with multipliers that use the
same value for both dimensions.</p>
<p>When you leave the game, the current settings for the Windows interface are
saved as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">angband.INI</span></code> in the directory that holds the executable.  Those
settings will be automatically reloaded the next time you start the Windows
interface.</p>
</section>
<section id="x11">
<h3>X11<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#x11" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the X11 front end, the number of windows opened is set by the ‘-n’ option
on the command line, i.e. running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./angband</span> <span class="pre">-mx11</span> <span class="pre">--</span> <span class="pre">-n4</span></code> will open the
main window and subwindows one through three if the executable is in the
current working directory.  To control the font, placement, and size used for
each of the windows, set enviroment variables before running Angband.  Those
environment variables for window ‘z’ where ‘z’ is an integer between 0 (the
main window) and 7 are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ANGBAND_X11_FONT_z holds the name of the font to use for the window</p></li>
<li><p>ANGBAND_X11_AT_X_z holds the horizontal coordinate (zero is leftmost) for the upper left corner of the window</p></li>
<li><p>ANGBAND_X11_AT_Y_z holds the vertical coordinate (zero is topmost) for the upper left corner of the window</p></li>
<li><p>ANGBAND_X11_COLS_z holds the number of columns to display in the window</p></li>
<li><p>ANGBAND_X11_ROWS_z holds the number of rows to display in the window</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sdl">
<h3>SDL<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#sdl" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the SDL front end, the main window and any subwindows are displayed within
the application’s rectangular window.  At the top of the application’s window
is a status line.  Within that status line, items highlighted in yellow are
buttons that can be pressed to initiate an action.  From left to right they are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The application’s version number - pressing it displays an information dialog about the application</p></li>
<li><p>The currently selected terminal - pressing it brings up a menu for selecting the current terminal; you can also make a terminal the current one by clicking on the terminal’s title bar if it is visible</p></li>
<li><p>Whether or not the current terminal is visible - pressing it for any terminal that is not the main window will allow you to show or hide that terminal</p></li>
<li><p>The font for the current terminal - pressing it brings up a menu to choose the font for the terminal</p></li>
<li><p>Options - brings up a dialog for selecting global options including those for the graphical tile set used and whether fullscreen mode is enabled</p></li>
<li><p>Quit - to save the game and exit</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To move a terminal window, click on its title bar and then drag the mouse.
To resize a terminal window, position the mouse pointer over the lower right
corner.  That should cause a blue square to appear, then click and drag to
resize the terminal.</p>
<p>To change the graphical tile set used when displaying the game’s map, press
the Options button in the status bar.  Then, in the dialog that appears, press
one of the red buttons that appear to the right of the label,
“Available Graphics:”.  The last of those buttons, labeled “None”, selects
text as the method for displaying the map.  Your choice for the graphical tile
set does not take effect until you press the red button labeled “OK” at the
bottom of the dialog.</p>
<p>When you leave the game, the current settings for the SDL interface are saved
as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sdlinit.txt</span></code> in the same directory as is used for preference files, see
<a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#user-pref-files">User Pref Files</a> for details.  Those settings will be automatically reloaded
the next time you start the SDL interface.</p>
</section>
<section id="sdl2">
<h3>SDL2<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#sdl2" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the SDL2 front end, the application has one window that can contain the
main window and any of the subwindows.  The application may also have up to
three additional windows which can contain any of the subwindows.  A subwindow
may not appear in more than of those application windows.  Unused portions of
an application window are tiled with repetitions of the game’s logo.</p>
<p>Each of the application windows has a menu bar along the top.  The “Menu”
entry at the left end of the menu bar has the main menu for controlling
aspects of the SDL2 interface.</p>
<p>Next to “Menu”, are a series of one letter labels that act as toggles for the
terminal windows shown in the application window.  Click on one to toggle it
between on (drawn in white) and off (drawn in gray).  It is not possible to
toggle off the main window shown in the primary application window.</p>
<p>At the end of the menu bar are two toggle buttons labeled “Size” and “Move”.
Each will be gray if disabled or white if enabled.  Clicking on “Size” when
it is disabled will enable it, disable “Move”, turn off input to the game’s
core, and cause clicks and drags within the displayed subwindows to change
the sizes for those subwindows.  Clicking on “Move” when it is disabled will
enable it, disable “Size”, turn off input to the game’s core, and cause clicks
and drags within the displayed subwindows to change the positions for those
subwindows.  Disable both “Move” and “Size”, by clicking on one if it is
enabled, to restore passing input to the game’s core.</p>
<p>Within “Menu”, the first entries control properties each of the displayed
terminal windows within that application window.  For the main window, you
can set the font, graphical tile set, whether the window is shown with borders
or not, and whether or not the window will be shown on top of the other windows.
For subwindows, you can set the font, the purpose (which is a shortcut for
enabling the subwindow content as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#showing-extra-info-in-subwindows">Showing extra info in subwindows</a>), the opaqueness (“alpha”) of the window,
whether the window is shown with borders or not, and whether or not the window
will be shown on top of the other windows.</p>
<p>Below the entries for the contained terminal windows, is an entry,
“Fullscreen” for toggling fullscreen mode for that application window.  That
entry will be gray when fullscreen mode is off and white when it is on.</p>
<p>In the primary application window which contains the main window, there is an
entry, “Send Keypad Modifier”, after that for whether key strokes from the
numeric keypad will be sent to the game with the keypad modifier set.  That
entry will be gray when the modifier is not send and will be white when the
modifier is sent.  Sending the modifier allows some predefined keymaps to work,
for instance shift with 8 from the numeric keypad to run north, at the cost of
compatibility issues with some keyboard layouts that differ from the standard
English keyboard layout for which normal keys have equivalents on the numeric
keypad.  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/angband/angband/issues/4522">https://github.com/angband/angband/issues/4522</a> has an example of the
problems that can be avoided by not sending the keypad modifier.</p>
<p>Below “Send Keypad Modifier” in the primary application window’s “Menu” is
“Windows”, use that to bring up one of the additional application windows.</p>
<p>The final two entries in “Menu” are “About” for displaying an information
dialog about the game and “Quit” to save the game and exit.</p>
<p>When you leave the game, the current settings for the SDL interface are saved
as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sdl2init.txt</span></code> in the same directory as is used for preference files, see
<a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#user-pref-files">User Pref Files</a> for details.  Those settings will be automatically reloaded
the next time you start the SDL interface.</p>
</section>
<section id="mac">
<h3>Mac<a class="headerlink" href="customize.html#mac" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the Mac-specific front end, you can use Apple’s standard mechanisms to
control window placement:  click and drag on a window’s title bar to move it,
click and drag on a window’s edge or corner to change the window’s dimensions,
and click the red button at the top left corner of a subwindow to close it.
To reopen a subwindow that you closed, use the Window menu from the Mac’s
menu bar while the game is the active application and select the entry near the
bottom of that menu that corresponds to the subwindow you want to see.  For a
subwindow’s entry to be enabled in the Window menu, that subwindow must be
configured to display at least one category of information:  see
<a class="reference internal" href="customize.html#showing-extra-info-in-subwindows">Showing extra info in subwindows</a> for details.</p>
<p>To change the font for a window, click on the window’s title bar and select
“Edit Font” from the Settings menu in the Mac’s menu bar.  That will open a
dialog which displays the family, typeface and size for the current font.
Changing the selection for any of those will change the font in the window.</p>
<p>Whether the game’s map is displayed as text or as graphical tiles can be set
by selecting Settings from the Mac’s menu bar while the game is the active
application and then choosing from one of the entries in the Graphics option.
Choosing “Classic ASCII” will display the map as text.  Any of the other options
will use some form of graphical tiles to display the map.  If you wish to
adjust how graphical tiles are scaled to match up with the currently selected
font in the main window, select ‘Change Tile Set Scaling…’ in the Settings
menu.</p>
<p>When you leave the game, the current Mac-specific settings are saved and will
be automatically reloaded when you restart.  The settings are stored in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Library/Preferences/org.rephial.angband.plist</span></code> within your user directory.
If you suspect those settings have been corrupted in some way or would like to
start again from the default settings, quit the game if it is running, open a
Terminal window (i.e. select ‘Go-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Terminal’ from the Finder’s
menus), and, in that Terminal window, run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">defaults</span> <span class="n">delete</span> <span class="n">org</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rephial</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">angband</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to clear the contents of the preferences file and any cached preferences that
may be retained in memory.</p>
