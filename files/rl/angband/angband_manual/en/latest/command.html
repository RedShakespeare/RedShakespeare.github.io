<h1>Command Descriptions<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#command-descriptions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus the
default key to use it. For those who prefer the original “roguelike”
keyset, the name and key of the roguelike command is also shown if it is
different. Then comes a brief description of the command, including
information about alternative methods of specifying the command in each
keyset, when needed.</p>
<p>Some commands use the “repeat count” to automatically repeat the command
several times, while others use the “repeat count” to specify a “quantity”
for the command, and still others use it as an “argument” of some kind.</p>
<p>Most commands take no “energy” to perform, while other commands only take
energy when they cause the world to change in some way. For example,
attempting to read a scroll while blind does not use any energy.</p>
<p>The following command is very useful for beginners,</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Command lists (‘Enter’)</dt><dd><p>This brings up a little window in the middle of the screen, in which you
can select what command you would like to use by browsing.  If you wish
to begin playing immediately, you can use this option to navigate the

<h2>Inventory Commands<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#inventory-commands" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Inventory list (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped. You can carry
up to 23 different items, not counting those in your equipment. Often,
many identical objects can be “stacked” into a “pile” which will count as
a single item.  Each object has a weight, and if you carry more
objects than your strength permits, you will begin to slow down. The
amount of weight you can still carry without being overencumbered, or the
amount of extra weight you are currently carrying is displayed at the top
of the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Equipment list (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Use this command to display a list of the objects currently being used by
your character. The standard body (which all races currently have) has
12 slots for equipment. Every equipment slot corresponds to a different
location on the body, and each of which may contain only one object at
a time, and each of which may only contain objects of the proper “type”.
For the standard body these are WEAPON (weapon), BOW (missile launcher),
RING (ring) (two of these), AMULET (amulet), LIGHT (light source),
BODY_ARMOR (armor), CLOAK (cloak), SHIELD (shield), HAT (helmet),
GLOVES (gloves), BOOTS (boots). You must be wielding/wearing certain
objects to take advantage of their special powers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Quiver list (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Missiles that you carry will automatically be put in your quiver.  The
quiver has 10 slots; it also takes up inventory space, so every 40
missiles will reduce your number of inventory slots by 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Drop an item (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon
floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in it,
Angband will attempt to drop the item onto an adjacent space.  Doors and
traps are considered objects for the purpose of determining if the space
is occupied. This command may take a quantity, and takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ignore an item (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">k</span></code>) or Ignore an item (‘^d’)</dt><dd><p>This ignores an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If the
selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a quantity. When
ignored, the game will sometimes prompt you whether to ignore only this
item or all others like it.  If the second option is chosen, all similar
items on the floor and in your inventory will be ignored.  To view all
items regardless of whether they are ignored, you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">K</span></code> to
toggle the ignore setting on and off.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wear/Wield equipment (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">w</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use this command. Since
only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an
item into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will be first be
taken off, and may in fact be dropped if there is no room for it in your
inventory. This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Take off equipment (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t</span></code>) or Take off equipment (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to your
inventory. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which cannot be
removed. These items normally penalize you in some way and cannot be
taken off until the curse is removed. If there is no room in your
inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and you will drop the
item after taking it off. You may also remove ammunition from your quiver
with this command. This command takes some energy.</p>

<h2>Movement Commands<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#movement-commands" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Moving (arrow keys, number keys) or (arrow keys, number keys, ‘yuhjklbn’)</dt><dd><p>This causes you to move one step in a given direction. If the square you
wish to move into is occupied by a monster, you will attack it. If the
square is occupied by a door or a trap you may attempt to open or disarm
it if the appropriate option is set. Preceding this command with CTRL
will cause you to attack in the appropriate direction, but will not move
your character if no monster is there. These commands take some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Walk (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">W</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>The walk command lets you willingly walk into a trap or a closed door,
without trying to open or disarm it. This command may take a count,
requires a direction, and takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Run (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code>) or Run (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">,</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in the
corridor, until you either have to make a “choice” between two directions
or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb you by setting
the disturbance options. You may also use shift plus the “roguelike”
direction keys (roguelike keyset), or shift plus the “original” direction
keys on the keypad (both keysets, some machines) to run in a direction.
This command may take an argument, requires a direction, and takes some
energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go up staircase (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Climbs up an up staircase you are standing on. There is always at least
one staircase going up on every level except for the town level (this
doesn’t mean it’s easy to find). Going up a staircase will take you to a
new dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (dungeon level 1), in which
case you will return to the town level. Note that whenever you leave a
level (not the town), you will never find it again. This means that for
all intents and purposes, any objects on that level are destroyed. This
includes artifacts unless the “Lose artifacts when leaving level” option
was turned off when your character was created, in which case the artifacts
may show up again later. The option to lose artifacts is off in the default
configuration. This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go down staircase (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Descends a down staircase you are standing on. There are always at least
one staircase going down on each level, except for the town which has
only one, and “quest” levels, which have none until the quest monster is
killed. Going down a staircase will take you to a new dungeon level. See
“Go Up Staircase” for more info. This command takes some energy.</p>

<h2>Resting Commands<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#resting-commands" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>

you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. You may
also use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span></code> key (both keysets). This command may take a count, and
takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Get objects (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">g</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you. Picking up gold takes
no time, and objects take 1/10th of a normal turn each (maximum time cost
is a full turn). You may pick up objects until the floor is empty or your
backpack is full.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rest (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can be told
to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or when various
conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when anything
disturbing happens, or when you press any key. To rest, enter the Rest
command, followed by the number of turns you want to rest, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> to
rest until your hitpoints and mana are restored, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> to rest until
you are fully “healed”. This command may take an argument (used for the
number of turns to rest), and takes some energy.</p>

<h2>Alter Commands<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#alter-commands" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Tunnel (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T</span></code>) or Tunnel (‘^t’)</dt><dd><p>Tunnelling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of rock,
with varying hardness, including permanent rock (permanent), granite
(very hard), quartz veins (hard), magma veins (soft), and rubble (very
soft). Quartz and Magma veins may be displayed in a special way, and may
sometimes contain treasure, in which case they will be displayed in a
different way. Rubble sometimes covers an object but is easy to tunnel
through, even with your bare hands.  Tunnelling ability increases with
strength and weapon weight. If you have a digging tool in your pack, the
game will automatically use this to dig. This command may take a count,
requires a direction, and takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Open a door or chest (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>To open an object such as a door or chest, you must use this command. If
the object is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your
disarming ability. If you open a trapped chest without disarming the
traps first, the trap will be set off. Opening will automatically attempt
to pick any door locks. You may need several tries to open a door or chest.
This command may take a count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Close a door (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so shutting
doors can be quite valuable. Furthermore, monsters cannot see you behind
closed doors, so closing doors may allow you to buy some time without
being attacked. Broken doors cannot be closed.  This command may take a
count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Disarm a trap or chest, or lock a door (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you fail,
there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can only
disarm a trap after you have found it. The command can also be used to
lock a closed door, which will create a hindrance for monsters. Even if
many monsters will be able to pick the lock or bash the door down, it
will often take them some time. This command may take a count, requires
a direction, and takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alter (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of
the “obvious” commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm),
and, by using keymaps, to combine this keypress with directions. In
general, this allows the use of the “control” key plus the appropriate
“direction” key (including the roguelike direction keys in roguelike
mode) as a kind of generic “alter the terrain feature of an adjacent
grid” command. This command may take a count, requires a direction, and
takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Steal (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This command is only available to rogues, and allows them to try and steal
from a monster.  Stealing works better when the player is stealthy and
faster than the target monster, and best of all when the victim is asleep.
A failed theft will wake the monster; if you really bungle the attempt, the
monster may shout out in anger.  This command requires a direction and
takes some energy.</p>

<dt>Browse a book (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code>) or Peruse a book (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">P</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Each class has books it can read and books it cannot; except for warriors,
who cannot read any books. When this command is used, all of the spells
contained in the selected book are displayed, along with information such as
their level, the amount of mana required to cast them, and whether or not
you know the spell.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gain new spells (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Use this command to actually learn new spells. When you are able to learn
new spells, the word “Study” will appear on the status line at the bottom
of the screen. If you have a book in your possession, containing spells
which you may learn, then you may choose to study that book. Most classes
may actually choose which spell to study, but if you are a priest or paladin,
your gods will choose a prayer for you. There are five books of each
realm, but hybrid classes - paladins, rogues, rangers and blackguards - can
only cast from two or three of these.  Higher level books are normally found
only in the dungeon. This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cast a spell (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">m</span></code> in both keysets)</dt><dd><p>To cast a spell, you must have previously learned the spell and must have
in your inventory a book from which the spell can be read. Each spell has
a chance of failure which starts out fairly large but decreases as you
gain levels. If you don’t have enough mana to cast a spell, you will be
prompted for confirmation. If you decide to go ahead, the chance of
failure is greatly increased, and you may wind up paralyzed for several
turns. Since you must read the spell from a book, you cannot be blind or
confused while casting, and there must be some light present. This
command takes some energy: the higher your level, the less it takes, but
the higher the spell level, the more it takes.</p>

<h2>Object Manipulation Commands<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#object-manipulation-commands" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt>Eat some food (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">E</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. There is a hunger meter
at the bottom of the screen, which says “Fed” and gives a percentage in
most circumstances. If you go hungry long enough, you will become weak,
then start fainting, and eventually, you may well die of starvation
(accompanied by increasingly alarming messages on your hunger meter).
It is also possible to be “Full”, which will make you move slowly; more
slowly the fuller you get. You may use this command to eat food in your
inventory. Note that you can sometimes find food in the dungeon, but it
is not always wise to eat strange food. This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fuel your lantern/torch (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">F</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>If you are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, then you
can “refuel” them with this command. Torches and Lanterns are limited
in their maximal fuel. In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern.
This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Quaff a potion (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">q</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Use this command to drink a potion. Potions affect the player in various
ways, but the effects are not always immediately obvious. This command
takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Read a scroll (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Use this command to read a scroll. Scroll spells usually have an area
effect, except for a few cases where they act on other objects. Reading a
scroll causes the parchment to disintegrate as the scroll takes effect.
Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be aborted (by
pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it
disintegrates. This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribe an object (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is
displayed inside curly braces after the object description. The
inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not
automatically transferred to all similar objects. Under certain
circumstances, Angband will display “fake” inscriptions on certain
objects (‘tried’, ‘empty’) when appropriate. These “fake” inscriptions
remain all the time, even if the player chooses to add a “real” inscription
on top of it later.</p>
<p>In addition, Angband will place the inscription ‘??’ on an object for you
if the object has a property (or “rune”) that you have not learned yet.
This inscription will remain until you know all the runes on the object.</p>
<p>An item labeled as ‘{empty}’ was found to be out of charges, and an
item labeled as ‘{tried}’ is a “flavored” item which the character has
used, but whose effects are unknown. Certain inscriptions have a meaning
to the game, see ‘&#64;#’, ‘&#64;x#’, ‘!*’, and ‘!x’, in the section on
inventory object selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Uninscribe an object (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">}</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This command removes the inscription on an object. This command will have
no effect on “fake” inscriptions added by the game itself.</p>

just a thought. Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item,
this command will let you activate its special ability. Special abilities
can only be used if you are wearing or wielding the item. This command
takes some energy.</p>

<dt>Aim a wand (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code>) or Zap a wand (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">z</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used. Wands are magical devices,
and therefore there is a chance you will not be able to figure out how to
use them if you aren’t good with magical devices. They will fire a shot
that affects the first object or creature encountered or fire a beam that
affects anything in a given direction, depending on the wand. An
obstruction such as a door or wall will generally stop the effects from
traveling any farther. This command requires a direction and can use a
target. This command takes some energy.</p>

<dt>Use a staff (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">u</span></code>) or Zap a staff (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Z</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This command will use a staff. A staff is normally very similar to a
scroll, in that they normally either have an area effect or affect a
specific object. Staves are magical devices, and there is a chance you
will not be able to figure out how to use them. This command takes some
energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Zap a rod (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">z</span></code>) or Activate a rod (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Rods are extremely powerful magical items, which cannot be burnt or
shattered, and which can have either staff-like or wand-like effects, but
unlike staves and wands, they don’t have charges. Instead, they draw on
the ambient magical energy to recharge themselves, and therefore can only
be activated once every few turns. The recharging time varies depending
on the type of rod. This command may require a direction (depending on
the type of rod, and whether you are aware of its type) and can use a
target. This command takes some energy.</p>

<dt>Throw an item (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>You may throw any object carried by your character. Depending on the
weight, it may travel across the room or drop down beside you. Only one
object from a pile will be thrown at a time. Note that throwing an object
will often cause it to break, so be careful! If you throw something at a
creature, your chances of hitting it are determined by your plusses to
hit, your ability at throwing, and the object’s plusses to hit. Some
weapons are especially designed for throwing.  Once the
creature is hit, the object may or may not do any damage to it.
Note that flasks of oil will do some fire damage to a monster on impact.
If you are wielding a missile launcher compatible with the object you are
throwing, then you automatically use the launcher to fire the missile
with much higher range, accuracy, and damage, than you would get by just
throwing the missile. Throw, like fire, requires a direction. Targeting
mode (see the next command) can be invoked with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> at the
‘Direction?’ prompt. This command takes some energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Targeting Mode (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This will allow you to aim your ranged attacks at a specific monster or
grid, so that you can point directly towards that monster or grid (even
if this is not a “compass” direction) when you are asked for a direction.
You can set a target using this command, or you can set a new target at
the “Direction?” prompt when appropriate. At the targeting prompt, you
have many options. First of all, targeting mode starts targeting nearby
monsters which can be reached by “projectable” spells and thrown objects.
In this mode, you can press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code>) to select the
current monster, space to advance to the next monster, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> to back up to
the previous monster, direction keys to advance to a monster more or less
in that direction, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> to “recall” the current monster, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">q</span></code> to exit
targeting mode, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code>) to stop targeting monsters and
enter the mode for targeting a location on the floor or in a wall. Note
that if there are no nearby monsters, you will automatically enter this
mode. Note that hitting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code> is just like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code>, except that the
location cursor starts on the last examined monster instead of on the
player. In this mode, you use the “direction” keys to move around, and
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">q</span></code> key to quit, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code>) key to target
the cursor location. Note that targeting a location is slightly
“dangerous”, as the target is maintained even if you are far away. To
cancel an old target, simply hit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> and then ‘ESCAPE’ (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">q</span></code>).
Note that when you cast a spell or throw an object at the target
location, the path chosen is the “optimal” path towards that location,
which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever choice of
a location on the floor for your target, you may be able to convince a
thrown object or cast spell to squeeze through a hole or corridor that is
blocking direct access to a different grid. Launching a ball spell or
breath weapon at a location in the middle of a group of monsters can
often improve the effects of that attack, since ball attacks are not
stopped by interposed monsters if the ball is launched at a target.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Character Description (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>Brings up a full description of your character, including your skill
levels, your current and potential stats, and various other information.
From this screen, you can change your name or use the file character
description command to save your character status to a file. That command
saves additional information, including your background, your inventory,
and the contents of your house.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Check knowledge (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code>)</dt><dd><p>This command allows you to ask about the knowledge possessed by your
character. Information that you can look up is:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>objects</dt><dd><p>Will display which objects your character is familiar with. For each
type of object, allows you to change whether or not it is ignored,
the representation of that type on the screen, or the inscription
automatically applied to all objects of that type. Some types of
objects your character will be familiar with from the start of the game.
Others come in “flavors”, and your character must determine the effect
of each “flavor” once for each such type of object. For a type of object
with a known “flavor”, you be also be able to display a summary of
what the object can do.</p>
</dd>
<dt>runes</dt><dd><p>Will display the “runes”, properties of enchanted objects, your
character is familiar with. Allows you to change the inscription that
is automatically appended to an object that has the rune.  Once your
character identifies a “rune” on one object, he or she will recognize
that property on other objects.</p>
</dd>
<dt>artifacts</dt><dd><p>Will display all artifacts that your character has encountered. Normally,
once an artifact is “generated” and “lost”, it can never again be found,
and will become “known” to the player. With the “Lose artifacts when
leaving level” option turned off, an artifact can never be “lost” until
it is “known” to the player. In either case, any “known” artifacts not
in the possession of the player will never again be “generated”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ego items</dt><dd><p>Will display the “egos” your character has encountered.  Each “ego” is
a collection of enchantments that can appear on an object.  “Egos” are
often restricted to only a few specific types of objects.</p>
</dd>
<dt>monsters</dt><dd><p>Displays the kinds of monsters your current or previous characters have
encountered. For each kind of monster, allows you to change its
representation on the screen. Some monsters are “uniques” which can be
only be killed once per game. For a “unique” that your current or
previous characters have encountered, this will display whether that
“unique” is still alive in this game.</p>
</dd>
<dt>features</dt><dd><p>Displays the types of map grids that can appear in the game.  For each
type, allows you to change its representation on the screen and how
that representation changes depending on the amount of light present.</p>
</dd>
<dt>traps</dt><dd><p>Displays the types of traps that can appear in the game.  For each type,
allows you to change its representation on the screen and how that
representation changes depending on the amount of light present.</p>
</dd>
<dt>shapechange effects</dt><dd><p>Provides a more detailed description of the “shapes”, magical effects
from some spells and a few items which change the shape of your
character’s body.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stores and home</dt><dd><p>Each of these will display the contents of the corresponding store
or your player’s home at the time your character last visited the
town. If your character is currently in town, what is displayed here
will be the current contents.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hall of fame</dt><dd><p>Displays a list of current and past characters, sorted by how far they
progressed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>character history</dt><dd><p>Displays a summary of what your current character has done.</p>
</dd>
<dt>equippable comparison</dt><dd><p>This displays a summary of the known properties of the equippable
items your character has access to, whether they are currently equipped,
in your character’s pack, on the floor at your character’s current
location, or in a store. Near the top of the display is a line, beginning
with “&#64;”, which summarizes the state of your character given his or her
current equipment. Every line after that corresponds to an item, sorted
by which equipment slot it can fill. The first character on each of those
lines is the representation of that item as it would appear in the map if
it was on the floor. After that is single character, “e” for equipped,
“p” for pack, “f” for floor, “h” for home, and “s” for store, which
indicates where the item is. The remainder of the line summarizes the
properties of the object, with one property per column. In the default
view, those properties are the resistances, flags, and modifiers present
on the item; they appear in the same order (left to right) as they appear
(top to bottom and then left to right) in the second part of the character
description. You can toggle back and forth between that view and one
that displays the effect of each item on your character’s key statistics
by pressing ‘v’. You can use ‘c’ to cycle through which items, based
on their location, are included in the display. The default is to show
only the items that are equipped, in the pack, on the floor at your
character’s current location, and in the home. The other options are:
show only the items in stores other than the home, show all items,
or show only those that equipped or in the pack. There are some
additional commands, notably for filtering which items are displayed based
on a particular property and for displaying the details about one or
two items. To see what those additional commands are, use the ‘?’ key
to bring up the in-game help for the equippable comparison.</p>

by pressing ‘/.’, you can find out that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code> symbol stands for a
floor spot. When used with a symbol that represents creatures, the this
command will tell you only what class of creature the symbol stands for,
not give you specific information about a creature you can see. To get
that, use the Look command.</p>
<p>There are three special symbols you can use with the Identify Symbol

monsters, and typing ‘Ctrl-n’ will recall details about all non-unique
monsters.</p>
<p>If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want to
recall details. If you answer yes, information about the creatures you

<section id="special-keys">
<h2>Special Keys<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#special-keys" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.</p>
<p>If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-c will interrupt
Angband. The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, since the
fifth will either quit without saving (if Angband was compiled without the
SETGID option which puts the save files in a shared location for all users)
or kill your character (if Angband was compiled with the SETGID option).
Also, ‘Ctrl-z’ will suspend the game, and return you to the original command
shell, until you resume the game with the ‘fg’ command. The ‘Ctrl-\’ and
‘Ctrl-d’ and ‘Ctrl-s’ keys should not be intercepted.</p>
<p>It is often possible to specify “control-keys” without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>) followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.</p>
<p>Pressing backslash (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code>) before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an “underlying command” key,
unless it is a caret (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
angband keyset. For example, the sequence <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code> + <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code> + <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6</span></code> will always
mean “run east”, even if the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code> key has been mapped to a different
underlying command.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code> keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no “useful” way to specify any of them as
an “underlying command”, which is okay, since they would have no effect.</p>
<p>For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE will abort
the command. The ‘[y/n]’ prompts may be answered with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code>, or
‘ESCAPE’. The ‘-more-’ message prompts may be cleared (after reading
the displayed message) by pressing ‘ESCAPE’, ‘SPACE’, ‘RETURN’,
‘LINEFEED’, or by any keypress, if the “quick_messages” option is turned
on.</p>
</section>
<section id="command-counts">
<h2>Command Counts<a class="headerlink" href="command.html#command-counts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them
with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until
you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as
being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn’t work to attack another
creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to
be repeated will flash by on the line at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>To give a count to a command, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code>, the repeat count, and then the
command. If you want to give a movement command and you are using the
original command set (where the movement commands are digits), press space
after the count and you will be prompted for the command.</p>
<p>Counted commands are very useful for time consuming commands, as they
automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also
terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any
character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a ‘SPACE’
or ‘ESCAPE’ which are always ignored as commands in case you type the
command just after the count expires.</p>
