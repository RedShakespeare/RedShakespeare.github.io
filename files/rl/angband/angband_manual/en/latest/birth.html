<h1>Creating a Character<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#creating-a-character" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of Angband. Perhaps the most important thing you
control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be
chosen various attributes that will affect the future life of your
character.</p>
<p>At the character creation screen you will be prompted to select the
race and class of your character. You also have the option to change the
‘birth options’ at this time. These need to be set at the character
creation menu and cannot be altered later in the game. They are discussed
with the rest of the options in the “options” help file.</p>
<section id="character-characteristics">
<h2>Character Characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#character-characteristics" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each character has two primary attributes: race and class. These
are chosen at the beginning and which will stay fixed for the entire life
of that character. The race and class have many effects which are discussed
in detail below.</p>
<p>Each character has a few secondary attributes: height, weight, and
background history. These are randomly determined according to the race of
the character, and are only used to provide flavour to the character to
assist in role playing.  There is an opportunity to edit background history
during character birth.</p>
<p>Each character also has five primary “stats”: strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, and constitution; they modify the abilities
of the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher,
into the “percentile” range, represented as ‘18/01’ through ‘18/100’:
this is the maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat.
These stats can be modified further by equipment, race and class bonuses up
to a maximum of ‘18/220’.</p>
<p>Each character also has several primary “skills”: disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, fighting skill, shooting skill,
and digging skill, which are derived from the character’s race,
class, level, stats, and current equipment. These skills have rather
obvious effects, but will be described more completely below.</p>
<p>Each character may have one or more “racially intrinsic skills”, based on
the race of the character. These may include special resistances, or
abilities such as infravision.</p>
<p>Each character has a number of “experience points”, which increases as the
character defeats monsters and attempts new spells and uses new items.
Characters also have a level, which is based on experience. The amount of
experience required to gain a new level is dependent on the character race
and class. Races and classes with more intrinsic benefits require more
experience to gain levels. As the experience rises, so does the level, and
as the level rises, certain other abilities and characteristics rise as
well. All characters start at 0 experience and at the first level.</p>
<p>Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it in the
dungeon. Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is
based on the character’s social class (higher is better) and stats (less
powerful characters start with more gold). Each character also starts out
with a few useful items, which may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for
more gold.  However, especially valuable items will never sell for the full
price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that they are prepared to pay for any
item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy your items for up to 30,000
gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and will pay no more than 5,000.</p>
<p>Each character has an “armour class”, abbreviated to AC, representing how
well the character can avoid damage. The armour class is affected by
dexterity and equipment, so the concept includes both avoiding blows and
being able to take blows without being hurt. Armour class on equipment is
always denoted in square brackets, usually as a figure of ‘[X,+Y]’ where
X is the intrinsic AC of the armour in question, and Y is the magical bonus
to armour class provided by that item.</p>
<p>Each character has “hit points”, or hp, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before they die. How many hit points a character has
is determined by race, class, level and constitution, as follows: each race
has a basic “hit dice” number - for instance, a Dwarf’s basic hit die is
11, while a hobbit’s is 7. This is modified by class: for instance, a
warrior gets a +9 bonus to the hit die, while a mage gets no bonus and a
priest +2, so a dwarven warrior’s total hit die will be (11+9)=20 - meaning
that they get between 1 and 20 hit points per level. If they were a priest,
his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get between 1 and 13 hit points per
level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps per level. (All characters
get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is a random roll of 1dX where
X is the hit die number, when the character goes up in level.) This is
further modified by constitution - a character with high constitution will
get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level (recalculated
right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, and you
are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)</p>
<p>Each character has spell points, or mana, which limits how many spells (or
prayers) a character can cast (or pray). The maximum number of spell points
is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom
(for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the maximum.
Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means. Warriors
never have any spell points. If a character gains enough wisdom or
intelligence to get more spell points, the result is calculated right back
to first level, just as with constitution and hit points.</p>
<p>Lastly, each character has a base speed. Speed determines the amount of
“energy” your character acquires in the game, and therefore how often you
can take actions which use up energy (like moving or attacking). All
beginning characters move at normal speed and the only way to increase
speed is by magical means and equipment bonuses. Characters who are
carrying too much weight will move more slowly. Extra speed is one of the
most important boons in the game and therefore one of the rarest and most
sought after.</p>
</section>
<section id="races">
<h2>Races<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#races" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are eleven different races that you can choose to play in Angband.
Each race has its own adjustments to a character’s stats and abilities.
Most races also have intrinsic abilities.  The bonuses to statistics and
the experience penalty will be displayed next to the races as you move
to select one.</p>
<dl class="simple" id="human">
<dt>Human</dt><dd><p>The human is the base character.  All other races are compared to them.
Humans are average at everything and tend to go up levels faster than any
other race due to their shorter life spans.  No racial adjustments or
intrinsics occur to human characters.  Humans do not have any infravision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="half-elf">
<dt>Half-Elf</dt><dd><p>Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human, but not as wise or
strong. Half-elves are slightly better at magic, disarming, saving
throws, stealth, archery and searching, but they are not as good at
hand-to-hand combat. Half-elves are immune to dexterity draining, and
have weak infravision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="elf">
<dt>Elf</dt><dd><p>Elves are better magicians than humans, but not as good at fighting. They
tend to be smarter and faster than humans, though not as wise or strong.
Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, archery
and magic, but they are not as good at hand-to-hand combat. They are
resistant to attacks involving bright light, are immune to dexterity
draining, and have fair infravision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="hobbit">
<dt>Hobbit</dt><dd><p>Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at shooting, throwing, and have good
saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming,
perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to
be called burglars. They will be much weaker than humans, and not good at
melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision. They have a strong hold
on their life force, and are thus resistant to life draining. Hobbits are
very partial to mushrooms and can identify them when found.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="gnome">
<dt>Gnome</dt><dd><p>Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the
halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent
mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching,
disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans
so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have good
infravision.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected against paralysis and
some slowing effects. Gnomes are excellent at using wands and staves
and can identify them when found.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="dwarf">
<dt>Dwarf</dt><dd><p>Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons
are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior
or priest - or indeed, that combination of the two, the paladin. Dwarves
tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist
spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have excellent infravision.
They can never be blinded. Dwarves are excellent at digging, and can
sense nearby buried treasure. They have one big drawback, though. Dwarves
are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.
In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="half-orc">
<dt>Half-Orc</dt><dd><p>Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible at
magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching,
disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs are, let’s face it, ugly. They tend
to pay more for goods in town. Half-Orcs do make good warriors and
rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great
constitution and lots of hit points. Because of their preference to
living underground to on the surface, half-orcs resist darkness attacks.
They have fair infravision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="half-troll">
<dt>Half-Troll</dt><dd><p>Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than any
other character race. They are also very stupid and slow. They will make
great warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at searching, disarming,
perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in
their presence. Half-trolls always have their strength sustained, and
they regenerate quickly like other trolls. Unfortunately, this
regeneration also requires them to eat more food than other races. They
have fair infravision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="dunadan">
<dt>Dunadan</dt><dd><p>Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West. This elder race surpasses
human abilities in every field, especially constitution. Their hardiness
ensures that their constitution cannot be reduced. They have no infravision.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="high-elf">
<dt>High-Elf</dt><dd><p>High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and
answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before
the sun and moon were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for many
thousands of years before returning to mortal lands. Because of this,
they are far superior in terms of abilities when compared to their lesser
Elven kindred. They can also see into the invisible world of ghosts and
wraiths. However, they find new experience harder to come by than other
races. Like normal Elves, they resist attacks involving bright light.
They have good infravision and can even see cold-blooded invisible
creatures.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="kobold">
<dt>Kobold</dt><dd><p>Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell underground.
They have excellent infravision, and are intrinsically resistant to
poisons of all kinds. They have a good dexterity and constitution.
However, they are weaker than humans, and also not noted for great
intelligence. Furthermore, they are ugly, and not trusted in town. And
while their constitution makes them tough, it still cannot prevent the
fact that they are not the biggest of creatures, and have few hit points.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="classes">
<h2>Classes<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#classes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  The class
is the character’s occupation and determines stat bonuses, abilities,
hit dice, and what spells (if any) the character can learn.</p>
<dl class="simple" id="warrior">
<dt>Warrior</dt><dd><p>A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most problems
by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
a magical device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and
dexterity, and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
other class. A Warrior will be excellent at fighting, shooting and
throwing, but bad at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
cannot learn any spells.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="mage">
<dt>Mage</dt><dd><p>A Mage must live by their wits. They cannot hope to simply hack their way
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. They can
master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
has the excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at him.
However, they are incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is their primary stat
and at high levels they can cast many spells without a chance of failure.
There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
are their true realm and they will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
other classes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="druid">
<dt>Druid</dt><dd><p>A Druid is a lover of nature, and at one with the natural world.  Druids
have control of their environment and direct power over creatures, leading
even to the ability to take their forms. Druid skills are moderate, and
they have some fighting ability, especially when transformed.  A druid will
usually seek to shape the flow of events to their purpose rather than
using devices or missiles, but at high levels they do gain access to
potent nature-based magic.  Druids rely on their wisdom, and have good
saving throws.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="priest">
<dt>Priest</dt><dd><p>A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
which spells they will learn. They are familiar with magical devices,
preferring to call them “instruments of God”, but are not as good as a
mage in their use. Priests have great saving throws, and make passable
fighters, better if they can find a blessed weapon.  Wisdom is the priest’s
primary stat and at high enough levels they can cast many prayers without
a chance of failure. Priests have poor stealth.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="necromancer">
<dt>Necromancer</dt><dd><p>A Necromancer seeks to master the spirits of sentient creatures, creating
servants of their own will. They have chosen a dark and wicked path, and
run a continual risk of harm to their own body and mind. Necromancers love
shadows and hate light, automatically shrouding themselves in darkness.
Their spells require high intelligence, and frequently harm the caster or
place them in danger.  In return they achieve awesome power at high levels.
The ultimate aim of the necromancer is to supplant the Dark Enemy and set
up a tyranny in his place.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="paladin">
<dt>Paladin</dt><dd><p>A Paladin is a warrior/priest. Paladins are very good fighters, second
only to the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons. They
receive prayers at a slower pace than the priest, but can use all but the
most powerful prayers. A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities.
Paladins have poor stealth, perception, searching, and magical device use.
They have a decent saving throw due to their divine alliance. Their
primary stats are strength and wisdom.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="rogue">
<dt>Rogue</dt><dd><p>A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by their cunning, but is
capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and
locks, to the experienced rogue no device is impossible to overcome. A rogue
has a high stealth enabling sneaking around many creatures without
having to fight, or sneaking up and get the first blow. They can steal items
from monsters, but need to be wary of being caught in the act. Rogues’
perception is higher than any other class, and many times they will notice
a trap or secret door before having to search. A rogue is better than
the more fighting oriented classes with magical devices, but still cannot
rely on their performance. Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the
powerful offensive spells mages can use, and there will always be a chance
of failure even with the simplest spells. A rogue’s primary stats are
dexterity and intelligence.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="ranger">
<dt>Ranger</dt><dd><p>A Ranger is at home in nature, and good at turning the environment to
good use. Rangers are good fighters, and the best of all the classes with
missile weapons, especially bows. The ranger learns chiefly spells of
survival and forest craft. A ranger has good stealth, good perception,
good searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
Their primary stats are strength, wisdom and dexterity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="simple" id="blackguard">
<dt>Blackguard</dt><dd><p>A Blackguard is a brawler of no principle, who lives for the joy of maiming
and killing. Blackguards prefer heavy weapons and shields, and learn a few
spells for the purpose of wreaking more destruction. Their lust for blood
is legendary, with a blackguard in full cry nigh on impossible to kill.
Blackguards scorn skills apart from slaughter, and require strength and
intelligence (or rat-cunning) to thrive in the dungeon.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="stats">
<h2>Stats<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#stats" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>After race and class are selected, you will be able to decide what stat
levels your character will have, by allocating a finite number of
“points” between the five statistics.  These points can be allocated
by selection or with a random roller (as described below in the “Stat
Rollers” section).  Each race/class combination also has a recommended
default setting for these statistics.  Statistics can be permanently
raised by various potions in the dungeon up to 18/100.  They can also be
temporarily drained by some monster attacks.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Strength</dt><dd><p>Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee combat. A
high strength can improve your chances of hitting as well as the amount
of damage done with each hit. Characters with low strengths may receive
penalties. Strength raises the amount of weight you can carry before
being slowed. It also allows you to get extra blows with heavier weapons.
Strength is one of the most important stats in the beginning of the game.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Intelligence</dt><dd><p>Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of spellcasters from the
arcane and shadow realms: mages, rogues, necromancers and blackguards.
Intelligence will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
well as the number of spell points you receive. Intelligence is the most
important stat for mages and necromancers. A high intelligence may also
improve your chances of successfully casting a spell. You cannot learn
spells if your intelligence is 7 or lower. A good intelligence can also
help with using magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wisdom</dt><dd><p>The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability of a priest or
paladin to use prayers, and druids and rangers to use verses, just like
intelligence affects spellcasting. Again, high wisdom will increase the
number of mana points you have and increase the number of prayers or verses
you can learn each level, while improving your chance of success. A good
wisdom increases your saving throw, thereby improving your chances of
resisting magical spells cast upon you by monsters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dexterity</dt><dd><p>Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity may
allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons. Dexterity
also increases a character’s chances of hitting with any weapon and of
dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks,
disarming traps, protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
inhabit the dungeons, and (for rogues) stealing successfully from others.
If the character has a high enough dexterity, thieves will never
be successful in stealing from them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Constitution</dt><dd><p>Constitution is a character’s ability to resist damage to his body, and
to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a high
constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them faster
while resting. Constitution is less important in the beginning of the
game, but will be the most important stat at the end.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="skills">
<h2>Skills<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#skills" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Characters possess some different skills which can help them to survive.
The starting skill levels of a character are based upon race and class.
Skill levels may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with
the level of the character.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Infravision</dt><dd><p>Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon
is cool or cold, infravision will not allow the player to see walls and
objects. Infravision will allow a character to see any warm-blooded
creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works equally well with
or without a light source. However, some of Angband’s creatures are
cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source.
All non-human races have innate infravision. Humans (including Dunedain)
cannot gain infravision unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does
not increase with character level, and is purely dependent on race and on
magical equipment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fighting</dt><dd><p>Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but with
high enough dexterity and strength may receive more blows with
lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
opponent. This skill increases with the level of the character. Inspecting
a weapon will show you how quickly you can attack with it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Shooting Ability</dt><dd><p>Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in this
skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this ability may
modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done,
and the ability to hit a creature. This skill increases with the level of
the character.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Saving Throws</dt><dd><p>A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of a
spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include
spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty
potion. This ability increases with the level of the character, but then
most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to
even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability. It is possible to
get 100% saving throw, making you immune to many attacks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Stealth</dt><dd><p>The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with good
stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow.
Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character entirely,
allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is based upon race
and class, but can be magically enhanced.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Disarming</dt><dd><p>Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also includes
picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain the
character a small amount of experience. A trap must be found before it
can be disarmed. Traps are either physical or magical devices, so the
character has two disarming skills.  Dexterity modifies disarming of
physical traps, and intelligence modifies disarming of magical traps.
Both these abilities increase with the level of the character.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Magical Devices</dt><dd><p>Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience and
knowledge. Spell users such as mages and priests are therefore much
better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This skill is

<h2>Stat Bonus Tables<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#stat-bonus-tables" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Stats, hit dice, infravision and experience point modifications due to
race and class are listed in the following table.  To get the total hit
dice, add the “race” and “class” numbers: for instance, a Dwarf Priest
has a hit die of 11+2=13 (i.e. they will get 1d13 hit points per level,
adjusted for constitution).</p>

<p>For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base
level of the skill, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out
the total skill value of any character’s skills, add the race value to the
class value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the
character has.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.</p>

<section id="stat-rollers">
<h2>Stat rollers<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#stat-rollers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are currently two different ways to determine the starting stats of
your character - you can choose which one to use from the birth screen.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Point-based</dt><dd><p>The point-based method allows you to “buy” improvements to your basic
stats by “spending” points on them. You have a fixed number of points to
spend, and making small changes to a stat costs proportionally less than
making large changes. Any unspent points are converted into your starting
money that you can use to buy equipment at the start of the game.</p>
<p>On selecting this option, you will find that the points have already been
assigned to default recommended values. These represent an algorithm’s
opinion for the ideal point spending. However, you are free to reallocate
them as you wish.</p>
<p>This is the recommended birth method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Standard roller</dt><dd><p>The standard roller simply rolls three six-sided dice for each stat,
leaving everything to chance. You can press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> to re-roll the dice, or
simply accept what luck has offered.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="character-name">
<h2>Character Name<a class="headerlink" href="birth.html#character-name" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character. In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself. For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk. The character name is used on the high
score list.</p>
<p>You can play a dynasty of characters. If you use a Roman numeral at the end
of your character name (like “Fred I” or “Pimplesnarg XVI”), the game will
automatically increment the numeral each time you die (or win!).</p>
