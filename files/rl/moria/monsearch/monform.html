After a tiny bit of code hacking, I produced a utility to dump monster
memories.  (This is based on something my ex-roommate did a long time
ago, for which the source code vanished.)

<p>
You can leave the monster character blank to get a listing of all
monsters.

    Enter your player's level <input NAME="plev" SIZE=2 MAXLENGTH=2><br>
